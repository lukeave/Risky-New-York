Municipal Patriotism and Preparedness 


HE distinguishing characteristic of an 
impulse is too often its impulsive 
ness. This is strikingly true of the 

patriotic impulse. 

Let the war-warped judgment of a sub 
marine commander decree the death of an 
American citizen; the public demand for 
discontinuance of similar crimes is prompt 
and peremptory. Let the officials of the 
offending country permit a repetition or 
two of the offense—with the loss, it may 
be, of less than a score of American lives 
and if war were the outcome, no city in the 
entire United States would lack the patriot- 
ism to back up the government with men 
and money to fight the nation’s enemy. 

But let the germs of preventable disease 
destroy, not a score, but a thousand Ameri 
can lives in one of our cities; the public 
demand for discontinuance of the crime is 
neither prompt nor peremptory. Let the 
lack of proper housing laws or the exist 
ence of unjust economic conditions permit 
the constant repetition of similar waste of 
life, and in no city is there as yet patriotism 
enough to back up the municipal govern 
ment with adequate preparedness in men 
and money for war against such an enemy. 

We say as yet advisedly, for the signs 
are unmistakable of an increasing recog- 
nition of the meaning of true patriotism. 
The impulse to defend national honor will 
exist as long as there are nations with any 
honor worth defending; but this impulsive 
spirit of patriotism so evident in times of 
international crises will be more and more 
reinforced by a daily life of patriotism in 
nation and state and city. And the result 
will be a type of preparedness that will 
place more emphasis on planning for better 
cities than on planning for bigger navies; 
and that will train our school children to 
become vigorous fighters for civic right- 


eousness as the first step in raising the 
standard of national honor, 

In the hope of emphasizing to some pur 
pose the idea of municipal preparedness, 
THe AMERICAN City will give special at 
tention to the subject this year in its is 
sues for January, April, July and October. 
he theme of each number will be ade 
quate forethought for municipal progress 
in general, and for the work of the season 
immediately following in particular. In 
accordance with this plan the present issuc 
will be found to contain a notable series of 
articles on the planning for physical im- 
provements in cities and for governmental 
efficiency and educational progress. 

On the subject of national preparedness 
THe AMERICAN Ciry, as a municipal publi 
cation, has perhaps little right to express 
an opinion. But we may be permitted to 
make at least this statement of fact 

Military and naval preparedness, under 
ideal conditions, represents a merely poten 
tial benefit to the disinterested citizens who 
pay for the bills—a benefit for whose de 
structive use most of them hope the occa 
sion will never arise 

Municipal preparedness, on the other 
hand, represents a definite, tangible benefit 
to the taxpayers every day in the year—a 
benefit constantly employed in defense 
against disease, dirt, discomfort and disas 
ter; a benefit which means clean and dur 
able pavements, a plentiful supply of pure 
water, adequate fire protection, the sanitary 
removal of sewage and garbage, the artistic 
lighting of city streets, and in general the 
conducting of our municipal governments 
with the minimum of waste and the maxi 
mum of efficiency. 

Whatever our views on national prepar- 


edness, let us have adequate municipal pre- 
paredness—public-spirited and with a plan.

The Value of Preparation for Street 
Improvements 


By Arthur H. Blanchard 





Professor in Charge of the Graduate Course in Highway Engineering at Columbia University, 
and Consulting Highway Engineer, New York City 


URING the months of January, Feb 


ruary and March many | 


demand the attention of municipal 


sroblems 


authorities who desire that street improve 
ments should be carried out on an econom! 
cal and efficient basis. Important among 
these are the perfecting of the administra 
tion and organization of the Bureau of

by which street improvements are to b

Administration, Organization and Functions 
of Municipal Highway Bureaus 


In the United States few municipalities 


have an efficient Highwav Department or 
ganization to which have been assigned the 
several branches of engineering and public 
works which logically belo Y under this 
important bureau. In the interests of 
economy and efficiency, all work pertaining 


to highwavs should be under the direction 
of the Chief Engineer of the Highway De 
partment and should include: surveys 
mapping, design of surface and sub-surface 


structures except bridges, construction, 


repairs and renewals of roadways, per 
mits for and repairs of street openings, 
sidewalks and other parts of streets, street 
cleaning, and the removal of snow, ashes 
and garbage. As typical of conditions in 
the United States is cited the present status 
of highway work in the Borough of the 
Bronx, New York City 


veys, mapping, street design, subsurface 


In this case sur- 


structures, construction and renewals of 
roadways are under the Chief Engineer of 
Highways; repairs and maintenance are 
under the direction of the Superintendent 
of Highways, while street cleaning and the 
removal of ashes and garbage are under the 
Department of Street Cleaning 


Financing of Highway W orks 
The Highway Department should submit 
to the municipal body having control of 


[2] 


appropriations a budget which gives in suf 
ficient detail the necessary appropriations 
to cover the overhead expenses of the ad 
ministrative and engineering organization, 
the general improvement of streets per se, 
the construction and _ reconstruction of 
roadways, and other parts of streets, the 
maintenance of roadways, street cleaning, 
and the removal of snow, ashes and gar 
bage. Only two details will be given spe 
cial consideration. 

In the estimate of the expenses of an 
efficient engineering organization, the aver 
age municipality should materially increase 
the item in the appropriation for services 
of inspectors of construction and mainte- 
nance. In many instances roadways are 
unsatisfactorily constructed and maintained, 
on account of the poor quality of inspection. 
This important branch of municipal work 
should be entrusted to engineers of consid 
erable experience in the handling of labor 
and in the details of the construction and 
maintenance of the several types of roads 
and pavements. 
such men should be permanent members of 


As a general proposition, 


the organization and be paid salaries of not 
less than $150 per month. In view of the 
increasing demand for highway engineers 
in states, counties, towns and municipalities, 
it is not generally practicable to secure men 
of the necessary caliber at salaries less than 
indicated. 

The people of the United States are be 
ginning to appreciate the fact that, in or- 
der that value should be received for the 
money expended in the construction of 
highways, it is necessary that the highways 
be efficiently maintained. Adequate main- 
tenance requires money in addition to en 
gineering skill. Some method must be de 
vised in order that the municipal authori 
ties having charge of financing public 
works should annually appropriate suf 
ficient funds to properly and economically 
maintain the streets. Hundreds upon hun 
dreds of miles of municipal highways are 
at present improperly maintained, often 
because of a lack of funds. The fact 














JANUARY, 1916 THE 
must be accepted that as years go on the 
financial burden of maintenance will be in 
creased, partly because of material addi 
tions to the mileage of improved highways 
in a given municipality. It should further 
be borne in mind that, if the appropriation 
for maintenance is curtailed in one year 
and many miles of streets are thereby leit 
unrepaired, the necessary appropriation in 
the following year for the repair of the 
neglected streets will be far in excess of 
the original funds required; for many types 
of construction wear very rapidly after 
they first begin to deteriorate. In the in- 
terests of economy, therefore, municipal 
bodies should give consideration to appro 
priations for maintenance prior to making 
expenditures for construction. 

If the financing of the several branches 
of highway work is to be conducted upon 
an economical basis, preliminary investiga 
tions must be undertaken on a broad scale. 
While it is true that such investigations re 
quire considerable time and a certain in 
crease in the appropriation for the engi 
neering organization, nevertheless wher- 
ever such investigations have been con 
ducted, ultimate

Preliminary Investigations 

The primary object of preliminary inves 
tigations is to enable an engineer to deter- 
mine, within certain limits, the design and 
the method of construction or maintenance 
which is most adaptable, from the stand- 
points of economy and efficiency, to local 
conditions. Our great railroad organiza- 
tions never undertake the construction of 
railways without first ordering a thorough 
reconnaissance, which would include a 
careful study of grades, distances, curva- 
ture, cost of construction and earning ca 
pacity as functions of location. Such pre 
liminary investigations are of as great eco 
nomic importance in highway engineering. 

A preliminary investigation for a given 
highway should include consideration of 
the following factors, some of which it is 
self-evident may be omitted in the case of 
certain highways: Location, foundation, 
drainage, esthetics, width, climatic condi- 
tions, traffic census, normal and abnormal 
weights and speeds of various classes of 
traffic, the probable change in the char- 
acter and amount of traffic after the im- 
provement of the street, topographical and

WIDTH 

In the determination of proper widths oi 
roadways for the several classes of street 
the present and future traffic must be give. 
due consideration. While it is true that a 
certain minimum width may be stated fei 
each of the types of streets, the economical 
and suitable width must be ascertained fo: 
each class, and in many cases for each 
street in the design of roadway widths f 
a given municipality. for the 
estimate of future traffic, a comprehensive 
traffic census should be taken.

For streets subjected to 
motor truck traffic, it is important to note 
that a large commercial truck backed up 
against the curb will occupy a length of 
about 13% feet. A truck on either side of 
the street in this position would, therefore, 
occupy 27 feet. The width out-to-out of 
the ordinary commercial motor truck is h« 
tween 6 feet and 8 feet 6 inches. To pro 
vide for the easy passage of two lines of 
vehicles between those backed up against 

















4 


the curbs would thus require an additional 
width of carriageway of about 17 feet, 
which would make the total width of car- 
riageway about 44 feet. For streets in re- 
tail business districts, the pedestrian traffic 
is of more importance and the sidewalks 
should be given adequate width. In resi- 
dential districts a carriageway of from 30 
to 36 feet is generally ample. Where a 
residential street is subjected to a light 
local traffic consisting principally of deliv- 
ery wagons and pleasure vehicles, there is 
no need for a roadway wider than 20 feet 

The number of lines of traffic for which 
provision is to be made on a given street 
is a controlling factor in the determination 
of the width of the roadway. In the days

nor mud, have a low tractive resistance, low 
first cost, low annual cost, low maintenance 
charge, and an esthetic and impervious sur- 
face. 

As an aid in the comparison of the rela- 
tive merits of the several types of roads 
and pavements, it is advisable to have at 
hand a table covering numerical values of 
certain factors which are susceptible to 
such form of comparison. The following 
table, which illustrates the treatment of the 
problem along these lines of investigations, 
gives assigned values for some of these 
characteristics of the different types of 
roads and pavements on the basis of ten 
for the value of the characteristic in an 
ideal pavement.

of horse-drawn vehicles, 7 or 8 feet was 
considered the unit width for one line of 
travel. In this connection it is of interest 
to note that the Highway Committee of the 
American Society of Civil Engineers rec- 
ommended several years ago that 

“Where motor traffic forms a considerable 
proportion of the total traffic likely to use a 
highway, the unit width of traffic lines should 
be considered as 9 or 10 feet, instead of 7 or 
8 feet, as heretofore, because of the greater 
clearance required for the safe passing of the 
units of such traffic.” 

Furthermore, as far back as 1908 the 
First International Road Congress held in 
Paris adopted the following resolution per- 
taining to the width of a highway to be 
subjected to two lines of traffic: 

“There should be but one roadway for every 
kind of vehicle proportioned to the intensity 
of the traffic, 19 feet 8 inches (6 meters) wide 
at least.” 


SUITABLE TYPES OF ROADWAYS 

In the selection of economical and suit- 
able types of roads and pavements to be 
used for roadways of streets, the properties 
of a perfect surface should be given care- 
ful consideration. An ideal road or pave- 
ment should be durable, noiseless, suitable 
for users, easily cleaned and made dustless, 
non-slippery for horses and all classes of 
vehicles under varying climatic conditions, 
easily maintained, should yield neither dust

It is necessary for each engineer to mod- 
ify tabular information of this character in 
order that the values shall be based upon 
local conditions. For instance, it is ob- 
vious that the numerical values assigned 

» “First Cost” will vary materially in ,dif- 
ferent sections. It is likewise apparent 
that it is impracticable to blindly add up 
numerical values with the expectation that 
the type having the highest value is the 
pavement to be employed. In the great ma- 
jority of cases one or more factors will 
also have a greater weight than certain 
other properties. Of course it is possible 
to weigh the values of a table and then 
obtain totals for comparison. The totals 
obtained by the summation of numerical 
values of properties referred to in the 
above table must, however, be supplemented 
by values attributed to factors which are 
not covered in the table, on account of their 
complex and variable character. As exam- 
ples of such factors may be cited cost of 
maintenance, durability, etc., which prop- 
erties are intimately related to local con- 
ditions pertaining to a given highway. 


Street Openings and Repairs 
Efficiency in this important branch of 
street maintenance may be promoted by: 
first, entrusting the Bureau of Highways 
with the granting of permits for street

openings; second, giving it charge of as 
sessments covering the cost of repairs; and, 
third, giving it control of the refilling of 
trenches and the reconstruction of founda- 
tions and surfaces. 

Under the proposed method of control- 
ling street openings, it is practicable for the 
Chief of the Highway Department to make 
the mecessary arrangements with depart 
ments or companies having control of sub 
surface structures, such as sewers, water 
and gas pipes, so that it will be possible to 
enforce a regulation to the effect that no 
street openings shall be made within one 
year after the improvement of the road- 
way. 

lf proper legislation can be secured, it is 
advisable to require that the connections 
for structures to be erected on unimproved 
property should be made prior to the con- 
struction of the street pavement. This plan 
has proved to be economical in the case of 
the city of Richmond, Va. As an effective 
detail for the repair of street openings, the 
method followed by the city of Reading, 
Pa., herewith quoted from its Regulations, 
is worthy of consideration: 

“In order to secure a proper bond and to 
prevent settlement, the city, when finally re- 
storing the pavement, will remove the con- 
crete base from a space which extends at 
least 6 inches beyond all sides of the maxi- 
mum area of earth disturbed so as to provide 
a firm bearing for the new concrete on the 
earth of the undisturbed margin of the trench, 
concrete to be beveled at least 3 inches out- 
ward at the top, and the wearing surface of 
the pavement will be replaced over an area 
extending at least 3 inches on all sides beyond 
the area of the new concrete.”

Street Cleaning 

Adequate provision should be made tor 
the installation of efficient equipment and 
the development of an organization to 
properly clean the various types of roads 
and pavements found in a municipality. 
rhe following methods applicable for the 
cleaning of various types of roadway sur- 
faces are given as illustrating requirements 
in equipment and organization dependent 
upon the type of roadway surface: 

Earth, gravel and broken stone roadways 
are cleaned by gangs or patrolmen with 
push brooms or by horse-drawn or motor 
driven rotary sweepers. 

Bituminous surfaces and good brick, bi 
tuminous and wood block pavements are 
cleaned of coarse dirt by gangs or patrol- 
men during the day and by hose flushing 
and squeegeeing or by rotary scrubbers or 
squeegees during the night. 

Brick, in poor condition, and stone block 
pavements are cleaned during the day by 
gangs or patrolmen and during the night 
with rotary brushes and hand or machine 
flushing methods. 

In all the methods the dirt is forced to 
the gutters and is usually removed by gangs 
with wagons following the machines. 


Engineering Service 
In conclusion, municipal authorities 
should bear in mind that in order to se- 
cure the maximum of efficient service from 
highway engineers, whether directly in the 
employ of the city or acting as consultants, 
it is necessary to allow sufficient time for 
the proper consideration of the several fac- 
tors upon which the economics of street 
improvements is based.

The city is dead, and forlorn is its plight. 
So the city must live by the life of its sons, 
As rivers are only the water that runs.

The Principle of the Gary Plan and Its 


Application to New York 
By William G. Willcox 


Member, Board of Education, New York City 


\ discussing the Gary plan, it 1s impor 

tant to distinguish between the prin 

ciple of the Gary schools and the ap 
plication of that principle 
schools ot New York. Th 
simple, the application complex and dif 
ficult; th 


to the public 
principle is 


principle hardly admits of an 
argument, the application is open to wide 
differences of opinions al d methods. 

The principle upon which the Gary plan 
is based is not economy, but diversified, in 
teresting and practical instruction. Super 
intendent William Wirt would relieve the 
schoolroom of the monotony of book study 
alone by introducing Professor Dewey's 
philosophy of “learning by doing.” Every 
one must realize the importance and value 
of giving a child an opportunity to apply 
his knowledge as he acquires it, to use it 
in a practical way by doing actual tasks 
Not only 
does such practical application help enor 
mously to fix the knowledge in the child’s 
mind, not only does it give the child a well 


and producing definite results. 


rounded instead of a one-sided develop 
ment, but it adds zest and interest to the 
school work. The child goes to school be- 
cause he wants to go rather than because 
he is compelled to go; the school work be 
comes a pleasure instead of a disagreeable 
task; and the joy of accomplishment, which 
is one of the greatest satisfactions in life, 
becomes at once a reward and an incentive. 

With such a course in view, the curricu- 
lum of Gary schools includes shop work in 
great variety, from manual training to 
highly technical work; auditorium exer 
cises in reading, speaking, drama, music 
and lectures; science laboratories, play- 
grounds, swimming pools and school gar- 
dens. The school day is lengthened to six 
or seven hours, and these interesting activi- 
ties are interwoven with the ordinary aca- 
demic subjects, giving variety and added 
interest to the school work and helping in 
a very practical way to fit the children for 
useful and efficient citizenship. 

In order to give these advantages to all 


[6] 


of the pupils and not a favored few, as is 
often done in other schools, and in order to 
do this without prohibitive cost, Mr. Wirt 
evolved in Gary, Ind., a new plan for the 
efhcient and economical use of the school 
building and equipment. Why, he says, 
should expensive workshops, auditoriums, 
gymnasiums and playgrounds be used only 
one, two or three hours a day? Why should 
classrooms stand vacant while their pupils 
are occupied in these other activities? Why 
not have all of these advantages used all 
day by alternate classes, so that the entire 
plant and equipment of the school may be 
employed to full capacity? On this theory 
it is no longer necessary to have a seat for 
every child, for the seats in the classrooms 
are used for different children and differ- 
ent classes, just as freely as are the seats 
in the auditorium. When one class leaves 
its classroom and goes to the gymnasium, 
workshops, playground or auditorium, an 
other class takes its place in the classroom, 
and by such alternate use all departments 
ef the school are occupied all she time. 

This, then, is the principle of the Gary 
plan—the use of the academic classrooms 
by two alternate classes, and the introduc 
tion of other activities to occupy the chil 
dren profitably while they are not in the 
classrooms and to give variety and added 
interest to their school life. 

In the application of this principle there 
is room for wide variations. No other plan 
is so flexible and elastic. The longer school 
day leaves time for a wide range of the 
other activities without lessening the usual 
academic work, and these other activities 
may be varied according to the opportuni- 
ties afforded by each school and its sur- 
roundings. Besides shop work, auditorium 
exercises, science laboratories, gymnasium, 
swimming pools and school gardens and 
playground activities, Mr. Wirt recom- 
mends supervised visits to public libraries, 
museums, art galleries, natural history ex- 
hibits, botanical gardens, public buildings, 
parks, bridges, etc.

In connection with such outside activiti

yn their way to or from school should stop 
for religious instruction at such church as 
their parents may elect. This, like all the 
other outside activities, is purely optional, 
and not in any way a vital part of the Gary 
plan. It is unfortunate that this sugges 
tion should have assumed such unwarranted 
importance in the public mind and created 
the impression that it is a necessary part 
of the Gary plan. Many members of the 
New York Board of Education feel that 
this suggestion should at least be held in 
abeyance for the present and that such a

be found that the aggregate number of 
teachers required will not be less than un- 
der the present system. Moreover, the cost 
of material and the upkeep of equipment 
for the workshops will be a large item of 
expense if the system should be extensively 
introduced. Industrial training is always 
far more expensive than academic educa 
tion, and the industrial training provided 
by the Gary plan is hardly likely to prove 
any exception in this respect. On the con- 
trary, it may be expected that the large 
economy in the cost of buildings secured 
by the double use of the classrooms will be 
in a measure offset by an increased cost of 
operation due to the expense of the indus- 
trial training. This is not a serious objec- 
tion, however, for industrial training is now 
recognized as such an important part of 
public school education that the need and 
demand for it cannot be ignored, and under 
no other system can such industrial train 
ing be provided as economically as under 
a plan which uses the shops and equipment 
all day long for alternate classes. 

The assertion frequently made that the 
Gary plan would result in larger schools 
and larger classes, is quite incorrect. On 
the contrary, while the number of classes 
will naturally be increased, the number of 
pupils in each class will not be increased; 
in fact, so far as the Gary plan has any 
effect on the size of the classes, it will de- 
crease rather than increase them. Classes 
in Gary are considerably smaller than in 
New York, and after provision has heen 
made in New York for giving full time to 
the pupils who are now on “part time,” any 
further increase in the number of classes 
must obviously result in a decrease in the 
number of pupils in each class. 

Most of the other objections voiced in 
public discussions and newspaper comments 
are aimed at minor details of administra- 
tion which are not vital features of the plan 
and which may easily be modified as expe- 


VoL. XIV, No. 1 


rience, or the judgment of our superinten- 
dents, may dictate. 

In regard to the question whether under 
such a double session plan the children will 
receive as much academic instruction and 
will progress as fast in fundamental aca- 
demic subjects as under the old plan, we 
have comparatively: little evidence in New 
York as yet. The children in the Gary 
schools are said to be further advanced in 
academic subjects than New York children 
of the same age, and Mrs. Ritter, the Prin- 
cipal of Public School No, 80, Brooklyn, 
says that the results of her tests of aca- 
demic work since the new system was in 
stalled have been the best ever secured in 
her school. Further results in this direc- 
tion will be awaited with interest. The 
time given to academic work is practically 
the same as under the old régime, and the 
results should certainly be no less satis- 
factory. 

Teachers, like other workmen, are slow 
to change their methods; superintendents 
naturally look askance at any suggestions 
from an outsider, and the public is easily 
persuaded that any suggested economy 
means starving the schools and robbing the 
children. All of these factors should be 
considered in weighing any objection to the 
Gary plan. Especially should it be cfearly 
understood that the prime object of the 
whole movement is not economy, but the 
improvement of our schools.. Mayor 
Mitchel’s and President Churchill's trip to 
Gary was not made for the purpose of sav- 
ing money for the city of New York, but 
for the purpose of bringing to our New 
York children richer educational advan- 
tages. The economy of the plan is impor- 
tant because it makes possible such im- 
provement in our schools as would other- 
wise be impossible. As the advantages of 
the plan are better understood, objections 
are likely to give way to such public de- 
mand for it as will surprise even its most 
enthusiastic advocates.

Centralized Purchasing in New York City 


A Notable Example of Effective Cooperation Between Independent Units in a City 
Government—A Year's Experience of Interest to Other Municipalities Desiring 
Increased Efficiency in Purchasing Supplies and Equipment 


By Henry Brueére 


Chamberlain, City of New York; Chairman, Mayor’s Committee on Central Purchasing 


for business management of its 


a 

fairs, the desirability of a central pur 
chasing agency for the entire city has been 
recognized. But nearly ten years went by 
before New York succeeded in taking an 
effective step away from scattered purchas- 
ing toward central purchasing. 

New York’s charter, which is state 
given, vests in 100 different divisions and 
departments of government the authority 
to purchase supplies. Provisions author 
izing these purchases and many more which 
are related to them must be stricken from 
the law and the Legislature must grant spe 
cific authority to the city to organize a 
central purchasing division before New 
York will be able fully to adopt a business 
practice to save hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a year in its expenditures. 

Since 1907 the State Legislature has had 
before it in one form or another a sugges 
tion for establishing a Central Purchasing 
Department for the city of New York. 
After seven years of consideration a meas- 
ure was passed in I915, but in a form 
which was objectionable to the Mayor, who 
declined to accept it in behalf of the city. 
Pending the grant of authority to centralize 
purchases in a single department, Mayor 
Mitchel, in December, 1914, organized a 
Central Purchasing Committee and directed 
the 28 heads of departments subject to his 
control to codperate through this commit- 
tee in making purchases on consolidated 
contracts. 

This work has continued successfully to 
date and is a notable example of effective 
cooperation between independent units of 
government. 

The Central Purchasing Committee or- 
ganized a central staff recruited from ex- 
isting departments to prepare proposals and 
to supervise the elaborate and complicated 
process of obtaining bids and making 
awards of contracts for all departments 
joined in the purchasing federation. 


S ‘ior New York first began to strive 





Obstacles from Obsolete Laws 

All the departments of the government 
under the Mayor’s control are ready to re- 
linquish their independent control of pur- 
chases, but they are unable to do so because 
New York may not in matters of this 
kind move either hand or foot until leg- 
islative sanction is given. In order to 
effect central purchasing without charter 
revision, scores of obstacles surviving in 
the present laws had to be overcome and 
unity of action brought about between a 
number of departments hitherto accus 
tomed to operate independently. 

When a coal contract is made, for exam- 
ple, the Central Purchasing Committee has 
no authority to open bids or to make an 
award. Executive representatives of all 
departments which are to receive a por- 
tion of the coal to be delivered under the 
contract must be present at the op ng, 
and the award of contract must be signed 
by the head of each of the departments 
affected. 

Fourteen of the Mayor’s departments in 
New York City purchase approximately 
500,000 tons of coal a year. An opening, 
therefore, for coal must be attended by the 
representatives of 14 department heads and 
contracts must be signed by 14 commis- 
sioners before coal can be delivered. 

All this would be rendered unnecessary if 
the Legislature would say to the city of 
New York, as it should: “Organize your 
administrative affairs in a way which your 
judgment determines to be most productive 
of efficiency and economy.” 

Although the improvised machinery for 
effecting central purchases in New York’s 
administrative departments is cumbersome, 
the experience obtained in making pur- 
chases will furnish valuable guidance in 
the conduct of a future department of pur- 
chases. It may also be of interest to other 
cities which are now insisting on the most 
effective business methods in buying sup- 
plies and materials.

Le ee I se le Oma 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


For a number of years purchases in the 
city of New York have been made under 
standard specifications promulgated by the 
Joard of Estimate and Apportionment. 
These specifications were designed to estab- 
lish uniform grades and qualities of sup- 
plies of a similar character utilized by dif- 
ferent departments. Uniform descriptions 
and specifications were a first step in the 
direction of insuring equality of return for 
the city’s supply expenditures made 
through different departments. To insure 
the compliance of deliveries with specifica 
tions where scientific tests were necessary, 
the city has maintained for five years a 
central testing laboratory which determines 
with scientific precision conformance of 
deliveries with contract requirements. 

Individual departments buying supplies 
are required by law to purchase those sup- 
plies and materials consumed in large quan- 
tities by competing bids and formal con- 
tracts. Supplies and materials consumed 
in smaller quantities or required under 
some special emergency are purchased on 
open market orders. A first step in cen 
tralization was to combine separate depart 
mental contracts for like supplies into a 
single contract, with a view to obtaining 
better prices as a result of larger quantities 
to be delivered. In some cases it was 
found, however, that quantities were so 
largely increased by reason of consolida- 
tion of purchases as to threaten to restrict 
competition. To overcome this condition 
the city was divided into zones and pro- 
vision made for awarding contracts not 
only in accordance with the different items 
of supplies required, but in accordance with 
the territory into which a supply is to be 
delivered. 


Results of the Year’s Experiment 


Despite a market disturbed by excessive 
European demands for certain classes of 
supplies, the consolidation of contracts has 
been of distinct financial advantage to the 
city. In summary, the advantage of the 
year’s experiment in codperative central- 
ized purchasing may be stated as follows: 

1. The cost of supplies has been in many 
cases decreased. 

2. Competition has been widened by the ad- 
dition of many new bidders attracted by larger 
quantities and given opportunity to bid on 
city-wide requirements, whereas they pre- 


viously bid on requirements of one or two de- 
partments only. 





Vor. XIV, No. 1 


3. The tendency of dealers to apportion dif- 
ferent departments among themselves, which 
restricted competition, has been overcome by 
consolidating proposals of all departments. 

4. Standard specifications have been revised 
and additional standards have been estab- 
lished as a result of the closer relationship be- 
tween the central specification agency and the 
work of purchasing. 

5. The cost of preparing and printing pro- 
posals and contracts has been materially re- 
duced as a natural result of consolidation. 

6. The central committee has functioned as 
a bureau of information and complaints, not 
only for departments but for dealers and those 
having contractual relations with the city. As 
a central point of contact the committee has 
been in a position to smooth out difficulties be- 
tween vendors and the city, to correct misun- 
derstandings, and to prevent much of the con- 
fusion that formerly resulted from scattered 
purchasing authority. Larger quantities, 
fewer delivery points, smaller territory where 
deliveries are to be made, and short-term con- 
tracts, all resulting from joint consideration 
of common problems by departments requir- 
ing supplies, have made proposals more attrac- 
tive to the trade. 

7. The establishment of a central sample 
room has been a great convenience to bidders. 

8. Closer coéperation between the buying 
function and the auditing function has been 
possible, thus making unnecessary the delays 
and inconveniences often occasioned by con- 
flicting action of these separate branches of 
government. 


The committee has been the means of 
bringing together as members of an asso- 
ciate committee the various purchasing ex- 
perts of the codperating departments. It 
is a singular fact that this committee fur- 
nished for the first time in the history of 
the city regular opportunity for confer- 
ences between the buying agents of the dif- 
ferent departments with respect to their 
common requirements. 

As a result of a year’s work, a clearer 
view is had of the problem of purchasing 
great quantities of supplies, the volume of 
which is indicated, for example, by the 
fact that in the past year the committee 
purchased 4,000,000 pounds of beef, 357 
tons of bread, 247 tons of butter, 269,199 
gross tons of coal, 487,360 dozen eggs, etc. 
The year’s experience or demonstration has 
confirmed the theoretical conclusion that 
central purchasing is desirable for so large 
a buying organization as the city of New 
York. 

The coming Legislature will be asked to 
establish a board of purchases for the en- 
tire city, authorizing the continuation of 
the work begun by agreement between the

departments of the government, and per- 
mitting the city to remove the elaborate rel 
tape and hampering restrictions with which 
the city’s purchasing power is now in- 
volved. 

It is not proposed to centralize forthwith 
all purchases in the central purchasing de 
partment, but to make a gradual transfer 
from the departments as the central agency 
becomes equipped to handle the vast trans- 
actions involved. Pending the passage of 
necessary legislation for the creation of a 
purchasing department, the committee pro- 
poses to take over in part the open market 
order purchases of the departments under 
the Mayor, instituting a practice of monthly 
requests in place of the individual daily or- 
ders under which such purchases are now 
made. When purchasing is finally effec- 
tively centralized and conducted with the 
standardizing, appropriating and auditing 
functions, steps will be taken to centralize 
the custody and management of stores. 


Experience of Value to Other Cities 


Out of the year’s work some definite 
points of experience have been gained 
which may be valuable to other cities. | 
cite them for what they are worth: 


1. By reason of consolidation of require- 
ments, there has been a general increase in 


the number of bids received for contracts. 
For example:

In a single case the number of bids received 
by the Central Committee was less than the 
average for the individual departments, name- 
ly, drugs and chemicals, individual depart- 
ments receiving 37 bids and the committee re- 
ceiving 23 bids. 

2. An important part of the effectiveness of 
central purchasing is the establishment of bet- 
ter relationship with dealers. The city must 
strictly enforce its specifications, exact from 
vendors scrupulous regard of their contract 
obligations and remove all supply purchases 
from the possibility of the question of irregu- 
larity or corruption. These are the negative 
aspects of its dealings with tradesmen. On 
the positive side it must seek out and encour- 
age reputable and effective vendors to bid 
upon its contracts. It must avoid the irritat- 
ing and discouraging practices so common in 
cities which serve to repel high-grade business 
men from city business. It must give evidence 


of scrupulous regard of business practice and

by conscientious study of its relations with 
dealers make city. business on the one hand 
attractive to high-grade veadors and impos- 
sible to middlemen and political tradesmen. 

In a recent report on its work, the 
Mayor’s Central Purchasing Committee em- 
phasized the improvement in relations with 
tradesmen resulting from its work. Be- 
cause this experience will be valuable to 
any city of any size, and relates to a phase 
of city purchasing which demands attention 
almost everywhere, I venture to quote from 
the report: 


Central Purchasing Committee an Aid 
to Dealers 


“An effort has been made in the preparation 
of each of the 55 proposals advertised through 
the Central Pure hasing Committee during the 
present year to make business with the city 
attractive to dealers and thereby widen com- 


petition. In the various trade classes this ef- 
fort has taken different directions. In pro- 
posals covering some classes of articles, 


greater progress has been made than in others 
towards securing what the Central Purchasing 
Committee and its associated members con- 
sider the most attractive form consistent with 
the protection of the city’s interest. In gen- 
eral it may be stated that from interviews with 
dealers, many hundreds of whom have re- 
ceived the committee’s proposals during the 
past year, the business of the city has become 
more attractive to them through centralization 
by reason of the following facts: 

“1. Dealers prefer to come to one place for 
information regarding the city’s requirements 
in place of the several necessitated by decen- 
tralization. Through centralization dealers 
know that all of the contract requirements of 
the Mayor’s departments may be brought to 
their attention at one interview and the dan- 
ger avoided of losing sight of any part of 
them. It has been the rule for the staff of the 
committee to answer definitely, accurately and 
courteously the many requests for information 
that are continually being received from deal- 
ers. All complaints have been given careful 
attention, and the committee has functioned 
as a central bureau of information and com- 
plaints to a large number of dealets engaged 
in doing business with the city. 

“2. Consolidation of quantities in several of 
the proposals has made attractive to many deal- 
ers business which heretofore has offered no in- 
terest to them on account of the small quan- 
tities required. For example, the proposals 
for meats and poultry have contained the com- 
bined quantities for four departments for the 
city as a whole or by zones: the proposals for 
coffee, milk, butter, cheese and eggs, forage, 
coal, canned goods and groceries, stock fruits 
and vegetables, cleaning materials and com- 
pounds, drugs, chemicals and reagents and 
laboratory apparatus, surgical instruments, 
hospital and miscellaneous supplies, have been 
drawn in the same way with as many as four- 


































































































































































































eer 




































































































































































teen departments combined in one proposal, 
and have offered the same cpportunity. 
Dealers in several of these lines have ex- 
pressed a high degree of satisfaction at this 
method of purchase and have stated expressly 
that the low prices offered by them have been 
due largely to this element. 

“3. An effort has been made to centralize 
samples in order to facilitate their inspection 
by dealers Thus the samples for canned 
goods and groceries, cleaning materials and 
compounds, household ware, clothing, dry- 
goods and notions, drugs, chemicals and re- 
agents, and laboratory apparatus, surgical in- 
struments, hospital and miscellaneous sup- 
plies for four or more departments have been 
consolidated and exhibited in one place. A 
sample room has been equipped with shelving 
and it is planned to take over as rapidly as 
possible the necessary samples for all pro- 
posals. Dealers have frequently stated that 
this is a great convenience to them 

“4. In order that proposals might not con 
tain consolidated quantities which were too 
large to admit of competition by dealers of 
medium capacity, quantities in several in- 
stances have been divided and offered in two 
or more lots. Thus, in the second contract 
for meat, the combined quantities of beef car- 
cass for the borough ot Manhattan, totaling 
165,000 pounds, were divided into three lots 
of about 55,000 pounds each. Small dealers, 
who could not have handled the entire amount, 
have been able to bid upon one or more of 
these lots, whereas large dealers have in no 
way been restricted by such division. 

“s. Effort has been made to make the pe- 
riods of the several contracts conform to the 
necessities of trade conditions. The European 
war has introduced an element of instability 
into many lines, and dealers naturally have 
been cautious in binding themselves for pe- 
riods so protracted as to make it impossible 
for them to forecast prices or the availability 
of their goods. The first contract for meat 
and poultry was for a period of three months. 
Consultation with dealers brought out the 
fact, however, that a number of them pre- 
ferred an even shorter period during the 
spring and summer of this year, when fluc- 
tuations in prices were the greatest. Begin- 
ning with April, therefore, the contracts for 
meat and poultry were drawn for one month. 
In the case of the proposals for canned goods 
and groceries, the departments individually 
in 1914 had contracted for varying periods of 
six months toa year. It was agreed, however, 
by the members of the Associate Committee, 
after consultation with the trade, that a three 
months’ contract in the class would produce 
better results under existing conditions. 

“6. Much care was taken in grouping the 
requirements of the departments to bring into 














14 THE AMERICAN CITY 


—] {o) 








Vor. XIV, No. 1 


the several proposals articles having a trade 
relationship, so that dealers might more read 
ily find classes of articles in which they were 
interested. For example, in the fuel proposal, 
anthracite and bituminous coal were offered 
separately. The former was divided into do- 
mestic, pea and buckwheat, and these in turn 
were divided into truck, carload and barge 
deliveries, giving an opportunity for bidding 
to mining companies as well as to wholesale 
and retail dealers. 

“7. In some instances the number of deliv- 
ery points has been reduced and large imme- 
diate deliveries specified. On the proposal for 
coffee, covering the requirements of the four 
institutional departments from February to 
the end of the year, it was decided to ask for 
two deliveries of the 188 tons of coffee re- 
quired, both to be made to one point—Black- 
well’s Island—to be roasted by the Department 
of Public Charities and distributed in city

partmental institutions. Butter for two de- 
partments for the latter part of the year was 
purchased in July in bulk for immediate de- 
livery to a storage warehouse. In both of 
these cases the purchase was made at a time 
when the market price was lowest. 

“The Central Purchasing Committee has 
heard very little comment from dealers ad- 
verse to the new plan of centralization, but on 
the other hand has had numerous voluntary 
testimonials to the advantages which the deal- 
ers feel they are receiving through the 
change.” 


This note on New York’s experiment in 
cooperative centralized purchasing ,is writ- 
ten not only to give information of progress 
under way in improving New York’s busi- 
ness methods, but also to invite suggestions 
and help from other cities and from those 
who have business dealings with the city. 
Clearly, no final step has been taken. A 
beginning has been made and the way is 
plainly seen for still further betterment. 
Above all, there has been found a gratify- 
ing spirit of codperation between all 
branches of the gcvernment affected—itself 
a stimulus to better government. 

I wish to acknowledge with hearty appre- 
ciation the earnest and effective work of 
the executive secretary of the committee in 
charge of its work, Mr. Frederick R. Leach, 
and of the staff under him, and to express 
appreciation for the practical, continuing 
and unassuming aid given by the New 
York Bureau of Municipal Research. 























A Discussion of Filter Troubles 


Notes on a Meeting of the New York Section of the American Water-Works 
Association, Held December 15, 1915 


By F. F. 


Longley 


Of Hazen, Whipple & Fuller, Consulting Civil Engineers 


Heavy Silt on Preliminary Filters 
R. George E. Willcomb, of the 
M Albany filter plant, described at 
some length the troubles resulting 
from a heavy burden of silt upon the pre 
liminary filters. These filters were built in 
the hope of so improving the water applied 
to the sand filters as to enable the latter to 
operate at rates considerably higher than 
those for which they were designed. In 
the operation of the preliminary filters dif 
ficulty has been encountered in washing 
the sand layer, the top 6 inches becoming 
silted up to such an extent that the wash 
water would divide it into sections which, 
being heavier, would sink to the bottom 
and soon form an impervious zone from the 
gravel to the top, so that the wash water 
could not keep it broken up and in a homo 
geneous condition, but took the course of 
least resistance through fissures or along 
the vertical walls. This has necessitated 
the periodical removal and washing of all 
the sand in the preliminary filters. The 
speaker described the methods used suc 
cessfully for making a good filter sand out 
of rather poor stock by successive wash- 
ings, and scraping and removing the fine 
material which the washings brought to the 
surface. 


Tron Removal from Well Waters 

Mr. Frank FE. Hale, Chief Chemist of the 
Department of Water Supply, Gas and 
Electricity of the City of New York, gave 
an interesting description of the process 
for iron removal from well waters at the 
old Baisley Pond and Springfield Pond 
filters upon the Brooklyn watershed and at 
Rockaway Park. He described laboratory 
experiments which indicated the apparent 
advantage of treatment with alkali over 
treatment by aeration alone in the removal 
of iron, but further on, in describing the 
practical operation of the Rockaway Park 
plant, he emphasized the fact that as good 
a reduction in the iron content was secured 


without the use of soda ash as with it. 
lhis he attributed to the extreme fineness 
of the floc produced by soda ash, and its dif 
ficult removal by the filters, and to the be 
lief that the sand acted not only as a filter, 
but as an oxidizing contact bed. This lat 
ter view opened the way to some discussion 
as to its correctness. However, the prac 
tical results of the simple treatment now 
in use of thorough aeration, ample time for 
oxidation and filtration through  well- 
ripened sand, are excellent. 


Troubles from Red Water and Coagulation 


At Little Falls, N. J., troubles from red 
water have recently been receiving consid- 
erable attention. Mr. F. W. Green, the 
superintendent of the plant, discussed this 
question at some length. They have for 
some time past been applying lime in the 
hope of offsetting the tendency to red water 
troubles. They 
tem of electrolyzing the water by means 
of a low density current gathering the car- 


are trying out also a sys- 


bonie acid as bubbles on a specially de- 
signed cathode, from which the bubbles are 
then removed. 

Mr. Green discussed also some of their 
difficulties in coagulation. Many plants 
throughout the country have during recent 
years had trouble with the appearance of 
coagulated aluminum hydrate in the ef 
fluent. The trouble appears to result from 
the existence of the coagulant: in an ex 
tremely fine colloidal condition and its re 
fusal under certain conditions to form into 
masses large and stable enough to be com 
pletely removed on the sand bed. The 
speaker atributed this in his case to the use 
of crude oil by the New Jersey Commission 
for mosquito extermination, this crude oil 
interfering with perfect coagulation. 

In the matter of disinfection of the fil 
tered water, Mr. Green called attention to 
the fact that the occurrence of a low or 
ganic content in the filtered water resulted 
in delicacy in the chlorine reaction, reduc-

He expressed the view that the 


supply was likely to depend upon the manu

ical or electrolytic processes 


Cleaning a Large Open Basin 

Mr. George R. Spalding, of the Hacken 
sack filter plant, described and illustrated 
with interesting pictures a device d« veloped 
at their plant for removing the deposited 
coagulant from the bottom of the coagu 
lating basin, with the basin continuously in 
service. This arrangement appeared to 
have many advantages and should be of 
interest to any operator who has to clean 
Mr. Spalding also dis 
cussed the difficulties experienced in the 
Hackensack plant with their brass solution 
piping. Repeated unfortunate experiences 
with different kinds of pipe brought them 
finally to the use of copper pipe with slip 
joints of an ingenious design, which avoid 
the use of threads on the pipe itself, thus 
obviating one ot the common weaknesses

of piping exposed to corrosive solutions. 


A Combination of Cleaning Methods 

The methods of overcoming some of the 
difficulties in the cleaning of the Bayside 
filters were set forth by Mr. Elmer G. 
Manahan, formerly of the New York City 
Department of Water Supply, Gas and 
Electricity. An unusual amount of study 
was put on the methods of cleaning these 
filters in order to secure the highest pos 
sible yield therefrom. The troubles seemed 
to arise, to some extent at least, out of the 
fact that the methods provided for filter 
cleaning in the construction of the plant 
did not do the work as thoroughly as it 
should have been done and as it can be done 
with more perfect facilities. 

The Brooklyn method of cleaning, so 
called, did not give satisfactory results. A 
hard crust was found to form just below 
the depth reached by the garden rakes used. 
Longer-toothed rakes were tried and then 
spading was tried to remedy this condition, 
but did not give complete satisfaction. A 
Nichols washing machine was tried, and 
also washing the sand in place by means of 


a hose jet. A combination of the last two 


HE AMERICAN 








Cree Voit. XIV, No. 1 
methods was mentioned as the most prom- 
ising for the Bayside filters, from the point 
f view of economy and efficiency. 


Air in the Filters 


Mr. Edgar M. Hoopes, of Wilmington, 
Del., put a great deal of emphasis upon the 
difficulties arising from the presence of air 
in the filters. Air derived from the more 
or less saturated,water passing through the 
sand is a common source of trouble in 
many filters. Mr. Hoopes attributed their 
troubles, however, not only to the air com- 
ing out of solution from the water, but also 
to air entering the bottom of the filters 
through cracks that have developed be- 
tween the bottom of the filters and the res 
ervoir underneath. 


Troubles at the Philadelphia Plants 


Some discussion of the troubles at the 
Philadelphia filter plants was presented by 
Messrs. Van Loan and Tolson, of the Phila- 
delphia Bureau of Water. At the Torres- 
dale plant, one of the principal troubles has 
occasionally been suspended matter of such 
a character and in such quantity that the 
plant could not handle it continuously and 
effectively. A remedy for this is now un- 
der construction. This consists in a basin 
of about 12 hours’ capacity which will per- 
mit a preliminary treatment by coagulation, 
reducing the turbidities and bacteria and 
preparing the water in such a way that the 
filter plant will give uniformly better re- 
sults, both in efficiency and capacity. The 
speakers discussed also the difficulties of 
treatment at the Queen Lane plant, arising 
from the accumulation of unusual quanti- 
ties of mud in the preliminary filters, and 
outlined the methods of sand handling and 
routine management by means of which 
they got around these difficulties. 

One unfortunate condition touched upon 
by the Philadelphia engineers was the dis- 
tance of some of the plants from the resi- 
dence section of the city, so that often, es- 
pecially during times of hard travel, the 
work of operating the filters is seriously 
interfered with by a shortage of labor. At 
times this shortage is overcome by working 
additional hours, but as the city labor re- 
ceives one-and-a-half time or sometimes 
double time for such work, as in many other 
cities, this condition does not contribute ta 
economy of operation. 





Preparation for Spring Extensions of Water- 
Works Service 


By Morris Knowles 
Consuiting Engineer, Pittsburgh, Pa. 


OME of the most trying experiences in 
the practice of the consulting munici 
pal engineer result from the procras 

tination of municipal officials with respect 
to authorizing the preparation of plans for 
work, followed by what often appears un 
reasonable haste to commence construction. 
Perhaps the engineer makes a report in the 
late summer or fall, recommending the in- 
stallation of a filtration plant, the construc 
tion of mains to improve fire protection or 
other extensions of service. The report is 
discussed at length until finally, when an 
agreement seems near, it is discovered that 
the law requires the advertising of contracts 
for a month and that construction will be 
thrown so far into the winter as to make 
work difficult. Perhaps also there is an 
election in November and the old officials 
who have about made up their minds on the 
report are retired, to be succeeded by a new 
group on January I. Naturally, they do 
not wish to do anything which might embar- 
rass their successors, and so the matter goes 
over to the new year. 

The new officers make a fresh start at the 
very beginning and all of the discussion is 
gone over again. But new public officials 
have many loose ends to pick up, and dozens 
of matters press upon them which appear 
more important than construction problems. 
So the discussion takes longer the second 
time, and finally the ground thaws and the 
beginning of spring is reached before they 
arrive at the same conclusion as their pre- 
decessors. 

Then one morning, about the first of 
April, the consulting engineer finds on his 
desk a telegram somewhat as follows: 

“Have advertised for bids in twenty days. 
Rush plans and specifications immediately.” 

Then the engineer's troubles begin. 
Everyone in his office works day and night 
for a week and somehow the plans and 
specifications are gotten out on time; but 
before that happens everyone in the office is 
tired out, errors creep into the computations 
and the specifications, and the groundwork 
is laid for later arguments with the con- 
tractor and possibly a lawsuit, which may 
cost the city a considerable sum of money. 


In these days when so much stress is be 


ing laid preparedness, such occur 
rences ought not to be permitted to occur; 
and yet the writer has had a sufhcient num 
ber of just such experiences to speak on 
the subject with a certain amount of feel 
ing. His first suggestion with respect to 
preparation for spring construction work 


would, therefore, be a very earnest one, that 


upon 


a decision be reached as early as possibl 
on the construction program and that the 
engineer be authorized to prepare plans 
and specifications a sufficient time in ad 
vance of the opening of the construction 
season to avoid the haste which makes so 
much waste if this policy is not adopted. 


Delayed Orders May Mean Higher Prices 


The hurried preparation of plans and 
specifications and the losses to the city due 
to the impossibility of sufficient considera 
tion and careful checking of plans, how 
ever, are not the only disadvantages of ex 
cessive delay in preparation for spring con- 
struction work. It not infrequently hap 
pens that prices of materials fluctuate con 
siderably between winter and spring. We 
have an example in the field of water-works 
construction to-day. Cast-iron pipe is 
steadily mounting upward and the pipe 
companies are promising quotations in the 
spring approaching those of 1907 and 1908, 
which all water-works men will recall. It 
is true that prices sometimes go down from 
the winter to the spring; but if plans are 
prepared sufficiently in advance, the city 
has the option of placing its contracts early 
or of waiting and taking advantage of the 
falling market. If plans are not so pre 
pared and the city’s requirements are not 
known, it has no option and must place its 
orders after the construction season opens 
at market prices, possibly at the cost of 
many additional thousands of dollars. 

This one feature of cost of construction 
material is especially important this year 
and it cannot be too strongly urged upon 
municipal officials to place their orders for 
pipe and other iron and steel materials at 
the earliest possible moment. 

With respect to operating supplies also, 
there may not infrequently be opportunity

ahead and placing contracts early At the 
rate at which alum is increasing in pric

sible to operate a rapid sand filter with

All of the advantages resulting - trom

ficient time for their consideration and de 
velopment than to rush out under stress o1 
a limited time fixed by a hasty call for bids 


at the beginning of the construction season 


Lay Your Pipes to Save Paving Wastes 

\nother important acvantage of early 
planning for water-works improvements is 
the insurance that may thus be secured 
against the tearing up of new street pave 
ments in order to lay water mains and ser- 
vices. The growth of the good roads 
movement has resulted in tremendous ad 
ditions being made each year 
of paved streets in 
towns. 


to the length 
American cities and 
Usually this work is started 
promptly in the spring and under the juris 
diction of a different city department from 
that in charge of the water-works. Unless 
there is planning ahead, not only for the 
single season, but also perhaps for some 
years, the result will be a lack of effective 
cooperation and a street pavement patched 
like a crazy quilt, which will break down 
in service within a short time, and which 
throughout its life will be a constant source 
of excessive expense for maintenance and 
repair. There are few more flagrant wastes 
of public funds than those resulting from 
laying of street pavements just prior to 
tearing them up to lay water mains, and 
none is more easy to avoid by planning 
ahead. 

[he most common type of water-works 
improvement is, of course, the laying of the 
annual extensions and mains made neces 
sary by the opening of new subdivisions 
and the growth of population and develop- 
ment of the city. No type of improvement 
lends itself more readily to planning in 
advance of the construction season. If the 
water-works department waits until appli- 


AMERICAN 





City Vor. XIV, No. 1 
cations are made for piping extensions, it 
will, of course, do nothing until well into 
the spring. Such applications do not come 
in until the construction of houses and the 
laying out of real estate subdivisions gets 
under way. This is no excuse for delay, 
however, as the growth and development 
of the city are sufficiently well indicated 
for the coming spring by the developments 
of the preceding summer and autumn, and 
information regarding a large proportion 
of projected developments may readily be 
secured at little or no expense, and made 
useful in connection with the proper plan 
ning of the spring construction program. 


Cooperation Between Water-Works and 
Park Departments 

One other feature of planning for water- 
works improvements the writer would like 
to mention as important to bear in mind, 
whether construction is done in spring or 
at any other season: that is the desirability 
of utilizing the surroundings of water 
works improvements in connection with 
the plans for park improvements in the 
city. This applies whether the improve- 
ments consist of a filter plant and pumping 
station in a remote location, a distributing 
reservoir in the suburbs, or a booster sta- 
tion or stand-pipe in the heart of the city. 

Water-works structures of all kinds are 
of a public character, whether owned by 
the municipality or a company, and as such 
should be given a setting worthy of this 
character. Moreover, a service so vital to 
the public health should attract the atten 
tion and investigation of the public, and 
not repel it. |Water-works properties 
should, therefore, be large enough to pro- 
vide, in addition to the absolute require- 
ments of the necessary structures, a sufi 
ficient space for the park and playground 
facilities of the immediate neighborhood, 
and the improvements, without being ex- 
travagant, should be such as will make the 
space attractive as a place of recreation for 
men, women and children. 

The location of water-works structures 
is ordinarily fixed by topographical or 
other engineering considerations, and they 
are apt to be scattered in various parts of 
the city. If water-works properties are 
properly laid out and improved, no addi 
tional park and playground space should be 
required in the immediate neighborhood. 
It is, moreover, very much less expensive

Park departments and officials should 
take this into consideration and effective 
cooperation in planning between the of- 
ficials in charge of the parks and those in 
charge of water-works should result. 





Progress in Town Planning and Civic Improve- 
ment in Canada 


By Thomas Adams 


Town Planning Adviser, Commission of Conservation of the Dominion ot Canada 


Town Planning Legislation 
HE work of the Commission of Con 
T servation in Canada, in so far as it 
is devoted to public health, town 
planning and housing reform, is receiving 
an encouraging response in most of the 
provinces of the Dominion. 

Nova Scotia has now the most advanced 
legislation along the lines of the British 
Town Planning Act; New Brunswick has 
the honor of starting the first town plan- 
ning scheme for an area of 20,000 acres 
within and surrounding St. John; and Al 
berta has recently procedure 
regulations so as to enable cities like Cal- 
gary and Edmonton to put into practice the 
schemes they have prepared. In Quebec 
and Ontario, the two most populous prov 
inces, town planning acts are likely to be in 
troduced at the next sitting of the Legisla 
tures, partly as a result of petitions received 
from local conferences and meetings in dif- 
ferent parts of these provinces. A draft 
act has been prepared for Saskatchewan 
and will be discussed at the next meeting of 
the Legislature. According to present indi- 
cations, it seems likely that within a few 
months six out of the nine provinces in 
Canada will have legislation dealing with 
town planning and giving effective powers 
to local authorities. 
inces— Manitoba, 


issued its 


The other three prov- 
British Columbia and 
Prince Edward Island—are not likely to be 
much behind and may also be induced to 
give the matter consideration during the 
coming sitting of Parliament. 

Side by side with the progress which is 
being made in getting legislation and in 
assisting local authorities with its practical 
application, there are a large number of 
cities and towns which have to be advised 


regarding replanning schemes. New town 


developments taking 
place and have to be considered. Among 
the most interesting of these at present is 
the proposal of the United States Steel 
Corporation to develop a new town at Ojib- 
way, near Windsor, Ont. Negotiations are 
in progress with the Corporation to insure, 
as far as possible, that the town will be laid 
out not only on picturesque and sanitary 
lines, but under conditions which will make 
it a model in regard to convenience, social 
amenities and the economical and healthy 
use of the land. 


are also constantly 


A Dominion-Wide Civic Improvement 
League . 

A Dominion-wide movement has _ just 
been started which will give supplementary 
aid to the work of the Commission of Con- 
servation in regard to civic improvement. 
At a recent conference held in Ottawa, a 
Municipal Improvement League for Canada 
was formed with the object “of promoting 
the study and advancement of the best prin- 
ciples and methods of civic improvement 
and development, of encouraging and or- 
ganizing those social forces which make 
for efficient Canadian citizenship, and of 
securing a general and effective interest in 
all municipal affairs.” A preliminary com- 
mittee of about fifty representatives of ex- 
isting organizations in different parts of 
Canada has been formed, the Chairman be- 
ing Sir John Willison, of Toronto. It 
seems likely that all the existing civic im- 
provement leagues and kindred bodies in 
Canada will give their support to the move- 
ment. At the conference inaugurating the 
League, Sir Clifford Sifton, on behalf of 
the Commission of Conservation, said that 
one reason for having such a body created 
was the need to improve the system of mu

nicipal government, which had been a par- 
tial failure in the past because it had been 
built up from a rural system and did not 
operate well in large municipalities. He 
also urged the need of better education, of 
getting at the problem which made slums 
and of controlling the deplorable specula- 
tion in land. 

Perhaps it will be interesting to those 
who are considering what should be the 
scope of voluntary organizations devoted 
to civic improvement to have a fuller state- 
ment of the questions with regard to which 
an endeavor would be made to secure pub- 
lic interest by means of the 
League. These questions are: 


1. The form and character of local govern- 
ment and the application of sound economic 
principles in regard to the administration of 
municipal business. 

2. The preparation of town planning 
schemes for the purpose of securing proper 
sanitary conditions, conveniences and amenity 
in connection with the development of land 
within and surrounding the area of the city 

3. The replanning of old districts, the re- 
moval of slum areas, the widening of public 
thoroughfares, and other reconstruction 
schemes. 

4. The conservation of the industrial and 
physical resources of the city, with special re- 
gard to the housing conditions and health of 
its citizens and the adequacy and efficiency of 
its public services. 

5. The preservation and increase of natural 
and structural beauty, the character and posi- 
tion of public monuments, the laying out of 
parks and open spaces, the planting and pres- 
ervation of trees, the regulation of public ad- 
vertising and the abatement of smoke and 
other nuisances. 

6. The preparation of civic surveys and 
maps, and the carrying out of investigation 
into housing, transportation and _ industrial 


Canadian 


conditions, methods of land valuation and 
assessment, etc. _ 
7. The promotion of school and college 


courses in civics and civic design, of exhibi- 
tions of works of art and of architectural en- 
gineering and other designs relating to civic 
improvements. and of public nerformances of 
music; and the provision of facilities for the 
recreation and physical development of the 
young. 

8. The means of securing increased produc- 
tion from the soil within and in the neigh- 
borhood of the city by encouraging the culti- 
vation of idle suburban land and a more wide- 
spread interest in gardening. 


With regard to organization, the inten- 
tion is to have the Commission of Conser- 
vation acting as a central bureau for the 
whole Dominion. Independent of the Com- 
mission there will be a Dominion Council 
which will organize occasional national 


OEE 


THE AMERICAN 


Ciry 21 


conferences and be representative of the 
nine provinces. For the present no action 
will be taken to form previncial leagues, 
but all effort will be concentrated in creat 
ing local leagues in each city, town and vil- 
lage. In time, when a sufficient number of 
these local leagues are formed in each prov 
ince, they will be asked to join together in 
provincial leagues. Some idea of the wide 
spread character which the movement is 
likely to take is indicated by the fact that 
some 700 correspondents in about 400 cities, 
towns and rural districts have promised to 
cooperate as members or in starting local 
committees or leagues. 

With regard to the need for such an or 
ganization to assist in promoting town 
planning and general civic improvement, | 
think it is recognized that efficient adminis 
tration of any law in a democratic country 
is only possible when public opinion is prop 
erly educated. Study and investigation of 
our municipal and social problems by edu 
cated citizens and the giving of expert ad 
vice by the best authorities will not lead to 
completely satisfactory results unless the 
people as a whole are aroused to an intelli 
gent appreciation of the advantages of what 
is being done for them. It is the penalty of 
having democratic institutions that we re- 
quire to devote so much time and attention 
to the education of the people. It is they 
who rule, and for that reason we have to 
try to raise the level of their intelligence. 
Unfortunatetly the present conditions of 
city life tend to lower both their physique 
and mental qualities and in the same meas- 
ure allow the quality of our national and 
civic governments to be lowered. The pro- 
posal to form a Civic Improvement League 
for Canada is merely a beginning in the 
work of trying to educate public opinion to 
make town planning and housing reform 
effective. The objects are intended to be 
wide enough to cover all questions relating 
to the use and development of land and the 
improvement of the citv, the town and the 
village community. This will be the first 
Dominion-wide organization of the kind in 
Canada. It is perhaps too much to hope 
that it will not be the only one, but it may 
be possible, for a time at least, to concen- 
trate in this one body all the interest and 
activities relating to civic work in the Do- 
minion and so avoid the overlapping and 
waste which result from 


a multiplication 
of societies.

24 THE AMERICAN CITY 


An annual expense of $500 a mile in re 
pairing residence streets would be consid 
ered an appreciable item of maintenance, 
yet that figure for cleaning a mile of resi- 
dence street through a season is extremely 
low. A cost of $500 for maintaining a mile 
of one kind of pavement for a year as 
against a cost of $1,500 for maintaining 
another kind would be sufficient grounds, in 
most cases, to decide in favor of the former 
material. Yet greater difference than this 
in cleaning cost as between competing types 
is blandly overlooked. 

A street cleaner looks for two qualities 
in a pavement: it must be smooth, and par- 
ticles of litter must not stick to the sur- 
face. The question of smoothness opens 
up the whole matter of durability. Any 
material that deteriorates and roughens 
becomes more difficult each year to clean. 
Any neglect of needed repairs means a 
larger cleaning bill until the repairs have 
been completed. 

Additional calculation of cleaning ex- 
pense must be made for all bituminous 
pavements on account of the sticking of 
particles of litter to the surface. These 
surfaces are never quite so clean as non- 
adhesive materials, and it costs from 25 
per cent upward in additional cost to put 
them in a reasonably presentable condition, 
on account of this quality. 

The substances most easily cleaned, that 
enter into pavements, are brick and stone. 
But in the use of these materials, the choice 
of a filler is all-important. A bituminous 
filler has all the disadvantages of a bitu- 
minous surface from a cleaner’s standpoint, 
and some others besides. Being softer 
than the brick or block, it recedes, leaving 
a crevice that invites the lodgment of dirt, 
With the edges of the brick or block un- 
protected, it is sure to roughen, thus add- 
ing to the difficulties of cleaning. 

So what I say in praise of brick and 
block pavement is meant to apply only to 
those built with a cement grout filler. I 
regret that | must rely upon general obser- 
vations rather than exact data in support- 
ing some of my statements, but it happens 
that we have in our office the result of 
observations made upon West Fourteenth 
Street, in Cleveland, with view to deter- 
mining the cost of cleaning. This is a 
grouted brick thoroughfare that has been 
paved some ten years and yet is in good 
enough condition to serve as a model of 


Vor. XIV, No. 1 


minimum cleaning cost. This street has a 
trafic of about two vehicles a minute. 
It has been cleaned, on an average, five 
times a week, being flushed by night and 
hand-swept in the daytime. The sweeper 
worked almost exclusively in the gutters, 
as most of the dust on such a pavement will 
be blown to the curbing in dry weather. 
The cost, per cleaning, amounts almost ex- 
actly to 15 cents per 10,000 square feet, 
which we call a “square” and use as our 
unit of calculation. 

This is the lowest figure that we hav: 
been able to achieve on any type of pave 
ment. The cost on the best asphalt pave 
ment would be not less than 20 cents and 
would rise to 30 as the surface became 
wavy or rough. A wood block pavement 
costs practically a dollar a square to clean 
in its initial condition, and it will be at 
least two years before the oil will have 
dried out sufficiently to admit of its being 
cleaned for 30 cents a square. A tar-filled 
block pavement will cost not less than 30 
cents per square, and, as the filler disap- 
pears and the blocks roughen, this cost will 
amount to 60 cents or more. 

In the case of a pavement 40 feet wide, 
there are about twenty-one squares to the 
mile. As between a material that can be 
cleaned for 15 cents and one that can be 
cleaned for 30 cents, there is a difference 
of $3.15 per mile per cleaning, a difference 
of $15.75 per week, or $630 per season of 
forty weeks, and $6,300 in ten years. And 
if, instead of 30, the cost of cleaning the 
latter pavement mounts to 60 cents per 
square, as is not uncommon under condi- 
tions of wear, the excess of cleaning cost 
will be $1,800 for a year, or $18,000 for a 
decade, above the figures that we have 
shown to be attainable on West Fourteenth 
Street. The successes of our department 
and the good sanitary record of our city 
are attributable in no small measure to the 
fact that we have miles of this type of brick 
pavement. 

Cleaning costs can be greatly reduced by 
a policy of prompt repairs. I believe in the 
continual patrol of all city streets by men 
whose duty it is to discover defects in pave- 
ments and prescribe repairs. Even from 
the standpoint of repair cost, such a system 
saves money. When cleaning is consid- 
ered, as well as repairs, the saving by a 
patrol system is so great as to make any 
other system a luxury.

The articles are published in alphabetical order, as listed above. As the manufacturers 
if of the various types of pavement are vitally interested in the proper construction and mainte- 
nance of their products, and have necessarily made a very careful study of this subject, they 
are able to offer thoroughly practical advice regarding factors to be considered and mistakes 
H to be avoided. It is not the intention of this series of articles to advocate the merits of any 
particular kind or brand of pavement. The assumption is in each case that a city has 
decided to lay a pavement of the type under discussion; the object of each article being to 
offer suggestions as to how the longest life may be obtained for such a pavement at the least 
possible expenditure to the municipality. 
i This series will be followed by one on various types of patented pavements.

While these include many commendable re-

purpose of this article to discuss chiefly the 
details of construction entering into a con- 
crete pavement and which are not found to 
such a degree in building a concrete road. 
lo begin with, the concrete pavement is 
fundamentally the road altered 
and strengthened to meet the requirements 
of the municipality, and under these 
changed conditions certain features of con- 
struction are encountered which are more 
imperative than in the road built for rural

adopted, is preferable; but for localities 
where suitable aggregates are not available 
and where the freight charges would make 
their cost prohibitive for this type of con- 
struction, the two-course pavement is to 
be recommended. This consists of a base 
course from 5 inches thick at the sides to 
7 inches thick at the center, composed of 
the local stone not suitable to withstand 
abrasion mixed in the proportion of 
1-2%-4. The wearing course is made 2 
inches thick of selected material of suitable 
wearing qualities; and if the coarse aggre- 
gate be graded up to I inch, a 1-1%-2!% 
mix is recommended. Details of construc- 
tion are practically the same as for the one-

course type, which will be considered in 
this article. 

Although the construction of a concrete 
pavement is not difficult nor complicated, it 
should not be undertaken by those inex- 
perienced in this type of construction 
without careful study, and if 
should be placed under the supervision of 
one familiar with all details. If the con 
struction of the pavement is to be awarded 
by contract, it is primarily essential that 
proper specifications be written; and even 
when the work is to be done by city force 
account, specifications should be in the 
hands of the person in charge. Standard 
specifications for concrete pavements, such 
as those adopted by the American Concrete 
Institute, should be closely adhered to, as 
they embody the latest and most expe- 
rienced ideas in this line of work. 


possible 


Drainage and Sub-Base 

Regarding drainage—the first, last and 
foremost consideration in any type of pave- 
ment, and of special importance in a pave- 
ment of a monolithic character—we find 
conditions altered from the country road 
with its deep side ditches. In the city, gut- 
ters are designed to provide adequately for 
surface drainage, but they do not take care 
of the ground water, which, unless inter- 
cepted, will in many cases collect beneath 
the road, to its detriment. To provide 
properly for drainage, a study should be 
made of the character of the sub-soil to 
ascertain whether or not it is self-draining 
and to determine where drains are neces- 
sary. The position of the drains will vary 
for each individual street, depending upon 
local conditions, but they should preferably 
he placed at least 2 feet below and outside 
of the pavement proper. All sub-surface 
drainage should be installed prior to the 
preparation of the roadbed, so that it will 
be quickly drained in wet weather and not 
delay the continuation of the work. 

The completed sub-grade should present 
a unitormly @ompact and even appearance 
and all inequalities in the surface due to 
the hauling of materials on the street or 
other causes should be eliminated. A fill 
requires thorough compacting, while the 
amount of rolling necessary in a cut will 
depend entirely upon the nature of the ma- 
terials encountered. It that no 
rolling is necessary, as some materials wil!

and in so doing will

slab and possibly force it out of position. 
Water in the sub-soil will have the same 
effect, and the heaving will be accentuated 
by frost.

care 


In case the concrete street is 
to be wider than the original road, it will 
necessitate the scarifying and spreading of 
the former road metal to the required width 
preparatory to rolling. 


The finished sub 


base should be true to grade. This can be 
accomplished best by testing with a tem 
plate, and in no case should be determined 
by guesswork. All excavations for pipes 
should be made as far in advance as pos- 
sible, care being exercised in the back fill 
ing to insure that no settlement takes place 
after rolling. 


Wearing Qualities in the Aggregates 

The durability of a concrete street de 
pends primarily upon the wearing qualities 
of its component parts. Particular atten- 
tion should, therefore, be given to this es- 
sential in the aggregates. The sand should 
be composed of quartzite or silica grains 
and must be free from any deleterious ma

table matter.

the use of flat or elongated particles must 
be avoided, as these will not embed them

should be well graded, with the coarse par- 
ticles in the sand predominant, in order to 
secure a minimum of voids and a resultant 
density of mix. 

Prior to purchasing, samples of aggre 
gates should be submitted for testing. If 
found satisfactory, similar material would

times to the approval of the municipal au

handling of the aggregates deposited on 














roadbed, extreme care should be exer- 
cised in shoveling to include only the mate 
rials intended for the concrete. Stone 


forks are to be recommended for handling 


the coarse aggregate. In extremely hot 
weather it is advisable to wet the agere 
rates, in order to prevent too rapid hard 
ening of the concrete, which will cause hair

Provided that a secure foundation has been 
built, concrete paving may extend from

longitudinal joint should be placed beyond 
the end of the ties to separate the muni 
cipal paving from that of the traction com- 
pany. In either case the bond between the 
concrete and steel rails should be broken 
by painting the rail with tar or asphalt.

used. It should preferably be a machine

which, in turn, are held true to line and

In setting 
up this combined joint, care must be taken 
to see that the plates do not sag and that 
they conform at all points to the true crown 
f the pavement. This can be acce mplished 
by setting the center of the installing de- 
vice at the correct height with a U-shaped 
pin. All holes left in the concrete after the 
removal of the installation bar must be im

If the street be in a rural or suburban dis-

tional initial cost of protection plates. In this 
case the filler is staked in position tied to

of the pavement; then as soon as sufficient

taking care to see that all the strings are 
cut, leaving the filler in place and compact 

ing the concrete against it. The filler in 
the unprotected joint should be allowed to 
protrude about 3¢ inch above the pave 

ment, and the concrete adjacent to this 
joint should be finished with a divided or 
split float to make the surface even and 
true to grade on each side of the filler 
The corner of the slab is then rounded or 
beveled off and the protruding filler flat 
tened into this depression, thus eliminating 
the sharp corner which is more susceptible 
to abrasion, and allowing the filler to pro 
tect the edge of the slab from wear. The 
protection thus afforded will have to be re- 
newed every year or two, depending upon 
the amount of traffic, and as the cost does 
not exceed twenty cents per joint this 
should not be neglected. 


Protecting and Curing the Concrete 

Our street is now complete except for 
the last and one of the most important op 
erations, that of protecting and curing the 
concrete. The hot sun and dry wind of 
summer tend to cause the concrete to 
harden very rapidly, often to such a degree 
that excessive contraction takes place be 
fore the concrete has developed sufficient 
strength to withstand these tensile stresses 
To prevent this it is necessary to retard the 
process of hardening, and this is accom- 
plished by keeping the concrete in a moist 
condition and protecting it from the ele 
ments. The street should be sprinkled as 
soon as the concrete will stand it without 
pitting. It should then be covered with 2 
inches of earth, which must be left in place 
at least two weeks under the most favor 
able conditions, during which time traffic 
must be kept off the street. Another means 
of curing and protecting, which can be used 
on light grades, is to keep the pavement 
covered with water by confining it with 
dams. 

During the fall, when the maximum tem 
perature is below 65 degrees and there is 
no danger of frost at night, the concrete 
will not cure and harden too rapidly if left 
uncovered. This does not mean that the 
concrete should be allowed to dry out rap- 
idly, as the surface should be sprinkled dur 
ing the middle of the day to retard the 
evaporation of moisture. When there is 
danger of a frost at night, the sprinkling

sideration and should not be lightly passed 
over. 


Reinforcement 

rhe matter of reinforcement I have pur 
posely not mentioned heretofore, as I wish 
to make a strong plea for its adoption on 
all city streets. Each year has seen a com- 
parative increase in the number of roads 
and pavements which are reinforced, anc 
to-day we find various state highway de- 
partments incorporating reinforcement in 
their specifications for concrete roads. Re 
inforcement not only prevents the slab from 
failing when tensile stresses are developed 
either from the heaving or sinking of the 
sub-base, but it also aids in preventing the 
formation of contraction cracks. If these 
should occur, it prevents their opening up, 
so that the cracks do not constitute a men 


ace to the success of the pavement. An

excess of one width of mesh; then after 
the reinforcement is in place, the 2 inches 
of concrete are deposited on top, and 
then the lower course for the next width 
and so on, it being made certain that 
the adjacent strips are thoroughly bonded 
together. Where recent excavations for 
pipes have been made, it is a wise precau- 
tion to place additional reinforcement at 
the bottom of the slab. 


Maintenance and Repairs 


Although the rapid increase in the adop- 
tion of concrete roads is due chiefly to the 
low cost of maintenance, nevertheless this 
does not mean that no maintenance is 
necessary. The joint filler of the unpro- 
tected joint will wear down, a crack may 
appear, a piece floated to the surface will 
be chipped out, or a soft stone may break 
and become dislodged. All these defects,

although trivial in themselves, should be 
treated at once, before traffic can wear 
down or disintegrate the sharp edges of 
the concrete thus exposed. This is best 
accomplished by first cleaning out the cavi- 
ties and then filling them with bitumen and 
dusting the surface with grit or sand. If 
the depth of the denression is more than 
14 inch and not over 3 inches, the sides 
should first be cleaned and then painted 
with tar, the hole filled with a graded stone, 
and hot tar poured cver the patch. All 
larger holes should be patched with con 
crete as follows: Make the sides of the 
patch as nearly vertical as possible. After 
thoroughly cleaning out the cavity, fill with 
water. This should be left in the hole for 
24 hours to allow the concrete to absorb 
all the moisture possible. Then bail out the 
water and paint the sides with cement 
grout; fill the depression with concrete of 
the same mix and consistency as was used 
in the original pavement; strike off with a

patch as heretofore mentioned 

If necessary to remove sections of th 


pavement on account of pipe or conduit ex 
cavation,. the concrete can be readily re 
paired The concrete pavement should be

edges trimmed to a vertical face. The ex

proportious as the former surface, and 
should be reinforced. Observy ill = pre 
cautions for mixing, finishing, curing and 


closing to traffic as recommended for ori 
inal construction. 

These slight repairs, with careful ol 
servation of the joints, constitute all the 
maintenance required on a properly con 
structed concrete pavement. If the defects 
are not allowed to assume serious propor 


tions, the cost is practically negligible. 





Recommendations by Cleveland Taxation Commission 


HE Cleveland City Council decided 
last year that a study should be 
made of the tax laws of Ohio with 

the object of recommending the amend- 
ment of the state constitution to provide 
home rule in taxation for cities and, fur- 
ther, for “any relief of the present financial 
condition of the city due to the inequalities 
of our tax laws.” The special Taxation 
Commission which Mayor Newton D. 
Baker appointed after a year’s study has 
published its final report. It contains the 
record of votes taken upon various taxa 
tion questions and shows that the Commis 
sion is unanimously in favor of: 

1. Abolishing the uniform rule; 

2. Enacting legislation for the classification 
of property for the purpose of taxation, with 
a recording fee on mortgages which would 
then be exempted from taxation; 

3. The appointment by the governor of a 
Taxation Commission to prepare a code of 
taxation laws for the state 

A considerable majority of the Commis 
sion is in favor of: 

1. Raising all state revenues by indirect tax- 
ation. 








2. Permitting a tax on growing land lues 
for purposes of local operation, and if a stat 
tax limit is m 1, granting all | | 
subdivisions the right to exceed the | I 
taxes on increases in land values 


By a majority of one the Commission 
approved: 

1. The raising of revenue for local opera 
tion by direct tax on land value only, and 

2. A direct and progressive state inherita1 
tax. 

The Commission disapproved 

1. A progressive tax increasing as the valu 
per front foot of land increases in lieu 
present rate for local purposes 

2. Increase in the liquor t 

3. County home rule in taxation matters 

The report includes a number of inter 
esting and instructive papers which were 
submitted to the Commission, as follows 
“Taxation in Ohio,” by John A. Alburn; 3 
“The Taxation of Growing Land Values in 
Cities,” by Prof. C. C. Arbuthnot; “What 
Should Be the Permanent Tax System of

The Landscape Development of School Grounds

schools i coming tant factors 

in the educational syste t the state 
but can we say as much concerning the in 
provement of the grounds around the ma 
jority of our school buildings? In many 
cases the surrounding grounds are not ma 
terially better than they were fifty years 
igo. We must often regret that the areas 
upon which beautiful and commodious 
buildings have been erected have not been 
more intelligently chosen, the buildings bet 
ter located, and the grounds more highly 
developed 1 harmony vith the prevailing 

type otf architecture 

In designing a modern school building the 
health and education of the student is re 
ceiving every attention he problems in 
volving interior arrangement, proper light 
ing, ventilation, and the control of tempera- 
ture, from both the economic and the es 
thetic standpoints, are receiving most care 
ful study \ll this is as it should be, but 


we should not forget that the proper moral, 
intellectual, and physical development of the 
student cannot be controlled simply by pro- 
viding beautiful and well-arranged build- 


ings 
Selecting the Site 
One of the first problems that should be 
more seriously considered by our boards of 


education is the selection t a proper area 
on which a new building is to stand. It is 
natural to desire a site in as central a loca 
tion as possible in order that distances may 
be shortened to accommodate the largest 
number of students. In the majority of 
cases, however, such a selection is made at 
great Sacrifice of area and of suitable con- 


tour of land, at the same time with loss of 


that most desirable element in an educa 
tional atmosphere—quietness 
School buildings are too often located on 
[36] 


small, rough, or iregular pieces of land, pet 
haps bordered on all sides by street cars or 
other heavy, noisy traffic, or by manufactur 
ing, simply because someone having a po 
litical pull had a piece of land that he could 
not dispose of for any other purpose, or at 
anywhere near the price the city or town 
could be forced to pay, or because a board 
of education has failed to appreciate the 
esthetic and economic principles involved 
Upon such sites beautiful buildings are 
erected, and hundreds, yes, thousands ot 
dollars are spent for grading and the con 
struction of retaining walls, steps, play 
areas, etc., with the inevitable result that 
such areas never satisfactorily accommo 
date student activities or permit the plant 
ing of trees and shrubs, or the maintenance 
of lawns, so essential to the best esthetic 
development. 

No matter how architecturally beautiful 
a building may be, its appearance, as a rule, 
is always improved by an appropriate land- 
scape setting. Such a setting usually con 
sists of a large area with the building prop 
erly located and the whole embellished by 
intelligent selection and arrangement of 
plant materials and _ other landscape 
features. Oftentimes the money spent in 
grading and the solution of other pre-con 
struction problems, together with the 
amount paid for the land over and above a 
fair normal price, would be more than 
enough to purchase a larger, more regular 
and better located area, capable of being 
developed at much less expense and provid 
ing all the necessary and desirable features 
in the form of play areas, plantings and 
general esthetic development. 


The Front Lawn and the Playground 

Every one should realize how much a 
proper foreground enhances the beauty of 
a building and how architectural effects are 
oftentimes entirely lost when buildings are 
located too near the street. But in order to 
make every foot of land available for play 
areas or other necessary features, beautiful 
buildings on small areas must be placed so 
near the street that much of their architec- 





nae 


ots 





tural beauty is lost. In such locations class- 
rooms are noisy and dusty, and the children 
are discharged immediately into the street, 
with all its impending accidents. 

School grounds should be large enough 
and the building so located that play or 
recreational areas can be provided at the 
rear or at one end of the area, never in 
front, as is so often the case, when we see 
tennis courts, basket-ball courts and sordid 
and dust-swept areas spciling the beautiful 
effect that trees, shrubs, flowers and green 
grass should produce. We do not lay out 
tennis courts in front of our houses where 
the lawns ought to be, because we believe in 
having open lawns bordered with shrubs, 
trees, flowers, etc. Why should we not just 
as appropriately apply the same principle 
of embellishment to the school homes in 
which the children of this country spend so 
large a proportion of their time, especially 
at an age when surroundings count much in 
the up-building of their mental, moral and 
physical fiber? If the school home is to 
compete with the temptations round about 
the growing child, it must be fortified with 
every excellence obtainable. 

Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and 
the young Garfield on the other, in keen dis- 
cussion, might illustrate the central life of a 
university, but no sane man would thereby 
argue that extensive buildings, spacious 
grounds, and modern apparatus are not es 
sential to the work the university must do 
to-day. What has been made to answer in 
the past will not do now; everything must 
be adjusted to the demands of the present 
and the near future. The needs of the 
future, especially, should receive more care- 


yful consideration, since many of the im- 


provements made to-day are intended to be 
permanent in character. 

City planning can accomplish a great deal 
along this line by providing early for future 
needs. State, county, city and town should 
unite in demanding by law that before plans 
for the numerous real estate subdivisions 
are accepted and filed they shall show proper 
areas reserved for school buildings. 


The Walks Through the Grounds 


Walks or drives are not in themselves 
ornamental, and are as a rule most ex- 
pensive in construction and general main 
tenance. They are more or less necessary, 
however, and may make or mar the whole 
scheme according as they are properly or 


JANUARY, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 37 





improperly locate as they approach the 
extreme in width and number. On small 
grounds or when the building is close to the 
street, a single entrance with a straight 


single or double walk is usually most ap 


propriate and most serviceable, but whe 
the grounds are large and the building is 


located some distance from the main street 
or avenue, an entrance near ¢ ich ront cor 
ner of the grounds, with walks laid out in 
easy, graceful curves, furnishes a most set 
viceable and attractive arrangement. 

The number and location of walks will 
be determined more or less by the number, 
importance and location of entrances to the 
building, as well as by the principal direc- 
tions from which the greatest number of 
students come. The width of walks should 
be governed by the number of students to be 
accommodated, and the number and relation 
of the walks to the architectural lines of the 
building. As a rule, walks are too numer 
ous, too wide, and poorly located, and, hence 
are the most conspicuous features in the 
whole design. 


Planting the Grounds 


Che most important elements to be con- 
sidered in the embellishment of school 
grounds are the plant materials to be used 
Nothing adds more to the beauty and suit- 
ability of such areas than a good collection 
of judiciously planted and well-grown trees 
In such material is found a great variety of 
useful and ornamental qualities; the ever- 
greens in particular are valuable for the 
protection they afford buildings and play 
areas from the sw eep of disagreeable winds, 
while the deciduous varieties furnish de 
sirable shade and comfort. 

Around the boundaries of the grounds 
should be planted some of the larger va 
rieties of trees, far enough apart to permit 
of full development and healthy growth. 
When grounds are large enough to permit 
of more than the boundary planting, group- 
ings of various other kinds of trees may be 
made, particularly in the corners, where 
they will not crowd upon the play areas. In- 
dividual specimens may stand out from 
such groups or may be planted near the 
building for the purpose of shade or direct 
embellishment. 


In the planting of home grounds, it is im 
portant to consider desirable views from the 
principal windows of the house, or the view 
points on the grounds, and to leave vistas

uldren can safely use the street as a pla 
ground. The playground is a little world, 
with its own problems and interests, and on 
its arena are taught tact, management 
leadership, quickness of thought and action, 
and many other sterling qualities 

Playgrounds may be divided into two 
classes—those for ordinary play on a small 
scale and those located and arranged for 
sports under the general name of “athlet 
ics.’ For the first class there should be at 
least two plots, one for girls and one for 
boys, located near the building. Each of 
these plots should be large enough to ac 
‘ommodate at least four or more different 
games at the same time. The area for the 
larger sports is usually greater, and should 
located farther away from the building 
than the so-called minor play areas. In 
schools where gardening or agriculture is 
taught, provision must be made for a suit 
able location of these interests, that they 
may be in harmony with the economic and 
esthetic development of the design as a 
whole. 

In this way the problems of school ground 
lesign and embellishment increase until 
they become so numerous as to demand 
most careful study by professional land 
scape gardeners. Let our school grounds be 
larger, the contours more adaptable, , the 
buildings better located, and the various ne- 
cessary features so arranged and embel 
lished as to produce the organized beauty 
and service essential to the welfare of our 


rising generation and of others to follow 





The New Band Theatre in Redlands, Cal. 


By Robert O. Bonnell 


Secretary, Chamber of Commerce, Redlands, Cal. 


PTIHE city of Redlands has built, as a part 


of its park improvements for the 

year, an amphitheatre or bowl. It is 
the only one of its kind in the state, and 
there are only one or two others like it in 
the country 


The bow! was built with two ideas in 


mind: first, the utilitarian idea, 
get a hundred per cent efficiency from the 
municipal band, and, second, the idea of 


beautincation 


For some time the Park Commission has 


been confronted with the problem of main 
taining order and seating the large crowds 
attending the band concerts each week 
The band, too, was fighting an echo and a 
stiff breeze which usually came up in the 
evening. These were some of the defects of 
the old system. Mayor George Cortner con- 
ceived the idea of the bowl, and, after con- 
sultation with the trustees and the city en 
gineer, City Forester Ferguson began work 
and rushed it to an early completion 

An ideal setting was found in Smiley

During the summer months the concerts 
held in the new bowl proved very popular, 
about 3,000 people attending each one. No 
less than 135 machines parked about the 
bowl, and the conduct of the crowd was 
admirable. 

Not only are band concerts given in this 
novel setting, but during the summer 
months the amphitheatre is turned over to 
the churches of the city for union services 
rom two to three thousand people attended 
these meetings during the warm weather. 
In cool weather the concerts are given on 
Sunday afternoon, and many other meet 
ings demanding a large seating capacity 
and of interest to the general citizenship of 
the city are held in the bowl. 





An Allegory of Metropolitan Planning® 
By J. Randolph Coolidge, Jr. 


NCE upon a time 38 families agreed 
to build a house. They had enough 
land, considerable borrowing capac- 
ity and unlimited self-confidence. Each 
family wanted to build its own part of the 
house exactly as it pleased. The cellar and 
the roof were admitted to be common to all, 
and after some discussion they decided to 
go shares on these parts of the building and 
have a builder and a building committee to 
look after them. 

Then they started to draw their plans. 
\nd the Brooklines planned an elegant suite 
with tiled baths, French windows, open fire- 
places and white marble exterior. The 
Miltons schemed a cosy flat with English 
half-timbered work outside and leaded win- 
dows; the Bostons laid out three stories of 
rooms, 26 in all, the lower story fireproof, 
the upper two warranted to burn in any 
weather. The Nahants wanted sleeping 
porches and white stucco, the Somervilles 
blocks, the Wakefields 
stained shingles and the Winchesters a Co 
The dif 


ferences did not stop with the outside; for

the Quineys stood for 7-foot studding, 
while the Reveres on the same floor wanted

row entry, while the Swampscotts beyond 


“Fy he Metropolitan City Plan- 


m, November 12-20, 1915. 





them wanted a wide one, and everybody 
quarreled over the placing of the stairs. 
The families on the ground floor didn’t 
need stairs and didn’t want to pay for any. 
[he top story families didn’t care to deaden 
their floors, and most of the plumbing pipes 
had to run through a neighbor’s best rooms 
and could be heard if not seen. 

When the plans were completed, the 
heads of families held an interesting meet- 
ing, at which each proclaimed his own needs 
and intentions, to be carried out regardless, 
or else he and his would go on living in a 
back street in an inconvenient ugly house 
all by themselves. At last some one said, 
“Let us call in an architect and show him 
our plans. I don’t suppose he can give 
every one of us exactly what we are asking 
for. Maybe some of our climbers will have 
to comfort themselves with cut-glass door 
knobs and silk rugs just for their own use, 
but if he knows his business he will give us 
the right kind of entries and halls and stairs 
and lifts, and will make the house look 
better, sell better, and cost less than our 
brilliant but inharmonious efforts. If we

A TYPICAL BREEDING PLACE 


FOR MALARIAL MOSQ 


Preparing to Abolish the Mosquito 


oy P. L. 


HE mosquito is a public menace and 
a public nuisance. There is no ex- 
cuse for his existence among us. 
He can and should be suppressed. It is 
now many years since it was discovered 
that mosquitoes breed only in stagnant 
water, and that the breeding insects can 
easily be killed by spreading oil upon its 
surface. It was evident, of course, that if 
stagnant water was prevented from accu 
mulating, no mosquitoes could breed. But 
up to some fifteen years ago this knowl 
edge remained purely of scientific interest ; 
no one seems to have thought of putting it 
into practice and getting rid of the pests. 
\bout that time it became known that 
mosquitoes were the carriers of malaria, 
yellow fever and other diseases, so that 
they had to be regarded as public enemies 
as well as public nuisances 
In many of the sections where yellow 
fever and malaria were common, steps to 
dispose of the fever carriers were insti 
tuted, and have been eminently successful. 
Everyone has heard of the achievements 
of our army medical corps at Cuba and 


Buttrick 


Panama in ridding ver-strick 
countries of the dreaded diseases by de 
stroying the insect disease carriers. How 
ever, in most of our country yellow fevet 
is unknown and malaria not universally 


common or fatal, so that the sharp spur of 


I 


public health has been to some xtent lack 
ing as an incentive in the campaign against 
the mosquito. So he too often lingers neat

our centers of population and recreation, 
being regarded simply as a nuisance. 

Early in the agitation against the mos 
quito certain individuals and small associa 
tions here and there attempted to 


grapple 


with the problem on a small scale he 
results, despite the general lack of knowl 
edge of methods of extermination work 
were locally more or less beneficial, but 
seldom resulted in complete relief Phe 
reason is simple: mosquitoes have wings 
and can fly—often surprising distances 


The individuals or associations could pre 
vent mosquitoes from breeding on their 


il 
own precincts, but were powerless to pre 
vent them from breeding nearby and flying 


over to torment them.

A Community and State Problem 


It is now fully realized that the solution 
lies with the community and the state. 
Since some mosquitoes migrate long dis 
tances, control must finally lie with the 
latter. As yet only a single state, New 
Jersey, has entirely assumed this responsi 
bility. New Jersey some years ago adopted 
legislation under which the state lends tech- 
nical and financial aid to such communi- 
ties where migratory mosquitoes breed as 
desire to rid themselves of the pests, and 
directly expends a certain sum each year 
in such localities as it sees fit. More re 
cently this state has gone even further and 
provided for the organization of mosquito 
extermination commissions in each county, 
and authorized them to raise funds with 
which to abate the mosquito nuisance. The 
good effect of these laws has been fully 
demonstrated. 

The Connecticut Legislature at its last 
session passed an act giving the Director 
of the Connecticut Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station the power to survey and drain 
mosquito-breeding areas where funds have 
been raised for the purpose, and rendering 
it incumbent upon the towns where such 
drainage work is done to maintain it. 
Eventually it is hoped to have the state 
make appropriations for such drainage 
work. Local health boards in Connecticut 
have certain powers to compel owners to 
clean up breeding places near human habi- 
tations. 

In New York State, health boards have 
been given broad powers to compel the 
owners to drain mosquito breeding areas, 
and it is under this law that the Department 
of Health of the City of New York has 
succeeded in having drained about 80 per 
cent of some 34,000 odd acres of the mos- 
quito-breeding marshes of Greater New 
York. 

Yet this last-mentioned method of con- 
trol is not altogether satisfactory, since it 
often places a large financial burden upon 
the owner of unproductive real estate, is 
difficult to enforce, and takes no account 
of the fact that frequently lands under a 
given ownership cannot be treated as a 
unit and codperation between owners can 
not always be obtained. 

In Massachusetts there have been at 
tempts to secure state legislation upon the 
mosquito problem, but with this exception 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


VoL. XIV, No. 1 


no other states than those just mentioned 
appear to have even considered the matter. 

There are three departments in the Fed- 
eral Government which have expert knowl 
edge of mosquito work. The Bureau of 
Entomology of the Department of Agricul 
ture, whose chief, Dr. L. O. Howard, was 
one of the earliest workers in the line in 
the United States; the U. S. Public Health 
and Marine Hospital Service; and the 
Medical Division of the U. S. Army, under 
which Colonel Gorgas, of Panama fame, is 
located. The last two departments are 
more interested in the destruction of yellow 
fever and malarial mosquitoes in the South 
and the tropics than in work in the North, 
where the mosquito is more of a pest than 
a disease carrier. The methods of work in 
the two sections are often different. 


What Some Communities Have Done 

Since it is evident that with one excep- 
tion little can as yet be expected from the 
various states, it is worth while to see what 
local communities can accomplish in the 
way of mosquito extermination. It often 
happens that cities and towns cannot be 
persuaded to expend public money for mos 
quito extermination, and health boards 
sometimes hesitate to exercise what au- 
thority they have in the matter, thus leav- 
ing it to voluntary organizations to under- 
take the work. 

Such voluntary organizations, if properly 
conducted and financed, can solve the prob- 
lem as far as it can be solved locally, and 
their efforts will make more evident the 
need of centralized control and effort. 

It may be worth while to note briefly the 
results of a few local campaigns. In the 
city of New Haven there is a permanent 
incorporated citizens’ committee, supported 
by popular subscriptions, which has drained 
in the three years of its existence over one- 
third of New Haven’s 1,200 odd acres of 
mosquito-breeding marshes, and has largely 
controlled breeding by oiling on the re- 
maining two-thirds. The committee hopes 
in a few years to drain all b eeding places 
and thus to finish its self- .ppointed task. 
It is expected that this will reduce the city’s 
mosquito crop by 98 per cent. Further up 
the Sound, notably at Fairfield, Stamford 
and Greenwich, other voluntary or semi 
official organizations have accomplished 
even more. Along the coast of Massachu- 
setts at Ipswich, Buzzards Bay and some 














 aaccaina

of the beaches near boston, many voluw 
tary organizations have also done work. 
Much extermination work has also been 
carried out by individuals and associations 
on Long Island and the Sound shore of 
New York State. The work of the city of 
New York has already been mentioned 
Even in New Jersey the success of the 
work depends upon the backing which the 
public gives to the state and county or 
ganizations. 

During the past season, which was a rec 
erd breaker as far as abundance of mos 
quitoes Was concerned, many new anti 
mosquito organizations were formed. In 
order to attempt the coordination of anti 
mosquito work in the vicinity of New 
York, where owing to the proximity of 
Connecticut and New Jersey the problem 
is an interstate one, representatives from 
these three states as well as from the Fed 
eral Government recently met in New York 
City under the auspices of the New York 
Health Department and discussed plans fot 
unifying the work. 


Where Mosquitoes ‘Breed 


It will perhaps be well to look for a mo 
ment at the mosquito himself and then to 
discuss methods for exterminating him. 
lhere are four principal types of mosquito 
breeding places: (1) wooded marshes; (2) 
fresh water marshes; (3) salt marshes; 
(4) dump heaps, catch basins, rain barrels 
and the like. 


(1) The mosquitoes ordinarily breeding in 
wooded marshes do not fly far, but they ar« 
often annoying near their breeding places, es 
pecially early in the season 

(2) Those which breed in fresh water 
marshes do not fly very far and are not apt 
to bite much except at night. However, they 
enter houses freely and their high-pitched 
song” as they fly about within a few inches of 
mir faces is often more of a sleep preventive 
than their bite. Fresh water marshes often 
breed the malarial, or Anopheles, mosquito 
Malarial mosquitoes are not generally a nuis 
ance, since they bite only at night and then 
not severely. They fly only short distances, 
but enter houses readily The wrigglers of 
the malarial mosquito can easily be told from 
those of the other kinds by their habit of 
swimming and resting with their bodies par 
allel to the surface instead of at an angle 
to it like those shown in the illustration 
When the adult bites, it stands almost on its 
head and its body is held almost perpendicular 
to the surface on which it rests. Most mos- 
quitoes stand with their bodies parallel to the 
surface. These differences are so easily no-

Planning the Campaign 


Should a few public-spirited individuals 
desire to better conditions in the commun- 
ity by eliminating the mosquito, they may 
be able to induce the local improvement so 
ciety or Civic association to take it up: if 
not, a special organization will have to be 
formed for the purposs he most 
cally American procedure is for 
terested ones to call a n 
plain their ideas, and let a committee be 
formed to look after the details Che work 
should be planned in the winter so as to be 
ready to start work ahead of the 
quitoes.

Once an organization is provided, three 
lines of further preliminary work 


ry suggest 


themselves: First, surveying the field to 


locate the breeding places and to estimate 


eee ers 









44 


the cost of the work of eradication; second, 
determining the legal aspects and status ot 
the work; third, raising the money. 

rhe most important work of the prelimi 
nary campaign is obtaining an adequate 
idea of the extent of the problem. The 
state entomologists or state health officers 
of the various states will sometimes go over 
the field and locate breeding places and es- 
timate the cost of their eradication. There 
are also experts and firms which make such 
work a specialty. 

A report on the mosquito conditions of a 
section should include: (1) a map showing 
the location of all important breeding 
places, (2) a general discussion of the 
problem, (3) a description of each breed- 
ing area and a statement of the treatment 
necessary to abolish it, (4) an estimate of 
the cost of eradication work. It is gen- 
eral to have a survey cover more terri- 
tory than it is expected to treat, so that it 
may be known what are the possibilities of 
receiving mosquitoes from outside the 
treated area. In inland places it is also 
necessary to consider the possibility of re- 
ceiving migratory marsh mosquitoes. A 
supplemental report on malaria and other 
mosquito-transmitted diseases, if they occur 
in the region under discussion, is often ad- 
visable. 

Since many states now have laws relating 
to the mosquito problem, it is well to have 
the laws on the subject looked up. A legal 
adviser or committee appointed for this 
purpose can also deal with the local of- 
ficials, particularly with the health board. 
Perhaps, when it feels that the public is 
behind it, the public organizations will co- 
operate with the legal committee and en- 
force what laws are in existence, The legal 
branch of the anti-mosquito organization 
can also undertake an investigation as to 
the ownership of all breeding areas and try 
to persuade the owners to remedy condi- 
tions on their own property. 

If the local government does not appro- 
priate funds, they must generally be raised 
by subscription. The public is never in 
doubt that mosquitoes ought to be sup- 
pressed, but is apt to be sceptical of the 
possibility of so doing; hence a more or 
less extended campaign to raise funds for 
the work is generally necessary. The 
methods of conducting such a campaign 
can best be worked out locally. However, 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


Vor. XIV, No. 1 


in presenting an appeal to the public it is 
well to lay as much stress as is justifiable 
on the fact that mosquitoes may be disease 
carriers. Although the malarial mosquito 
is far less annoying than most of his non- 
malarial brethren, it is easier to arouse in- 
terest in the campaign if he is made a 
prominent “goat.” If statistics can be pro- 
duced showing the amount of malaria in 
the section and the cases traced to infec 
tion breeding places, it is a powerful argu 
ment, 

When it comes to. soliciting funds, 
owners of land containing breeding places 
can be asked either to contribute sums suf- 
ficient to remedy them, or to eliminate the 
breeding places themselves, and the citizens 
generally can be asked to contribute ac 
cording to their means. Certain classes of 
citizens can often be appealed to along spe 
cial lines. Indifferent property owners or 
real estate companies holding lands for 
speculation or development can sometimes 
be reached by pointing out the fact that 
the absence of mosquitoes means increased 
property values. Hotel and resort proprie 
tors can often be influenced by the argu- 
ment that the abolition of the mosquito 
nuisance will bring them increased patron- 
age. Owners of salt marshes may some- 
times be induced to aid, or at least hot to 
obstruct the work, when it is made evident 
to them that ditching their meadows will 
increase their hay yield. Railroads, trolley 
lines and other public service corporations 
frequently own marsh lands which are pro- 
lific mosquito breeders. It is often easier 
for a railroad in building an embankment 
across a marsh to block its drainage, and 
thus create bad breeding spots, than to con- 
struct proper culverts to keep the drainage 
courses open. Sometimes such public ser- 
vice corporations may be induced to live 
up to their names in this regard and pre- 
vent or abolish these things. Sometimes 
publicly owned lands are mosquito breed- 
ing areas. It even happens that mosquitoes 
sometimes breed abundantly in the public 
parks. The authorities should be made to 
feel that the public demands that such con- 
ditions be remedied. 


Control Measures 


After the money has been raised comes 
the actual work of eradication. How much 
can be accomplished will depend, of course,

recourse must frequertly be made to more 
primitive methods. These spades are usu 
ally built to cut a ditch 30 inches deep by 
to inches wide. A set of ditches of this 
size spaced from 100 to 400 feet apart is 
usually adequate to drain a marsh suf 
ficiently to prevent mosquitoes from breed 
ing upon it, although in bad marshes cross 
ditches draining individua! pools may be 
necessary in addition. The cost for dig 
ging such ditches generally ranges from $8 
to $12 per acre. 


Oiling and Other Temporary Work 

It is one thing to pour a little oil on the 
top of a rain barrel and watch the wrig 
glers cease to wriggle, and quite another to 
spread enough oil over marshes many acres 
in extent to kill all the insects breeding 
therein. It takes an organized force to keep 
down breeding over extensive areas. The 
best scheme of organization seems to be to 
have a small permanent crew of trained 
men capable of scouting and inspection as 
well as oiling, who are familiar with the 
entire territory, and who in ordinary times 
do inspection work and such oiling as is 
necessary. In periods of intense breeding, 
such as follow heavy rains—or, in the case 
of salt marshes, after high tides—extra 
laborers can be enlisted to work under the 
direction of the permanent force. Such an 
organization, consisting of a chief inspec 
tor and three or four assistants, can readily 
be expanded on short notice to a force of 
twenty or thirty. 

Several types of outfits are used for oil- 
ing under the different conditions which are 
encountered. To check breeding in catch 
basins, water troughs and the like, it is 
sufficient to pour oil on them directly from 
the can or with a sprinkling pot. Wher 
breeding in natural breeding places is scat 
tered and light, the men carry light hand 
or knapsack spray pumps and a small dip 
per to test the water for wrigglers. Some 
times a reserve supply of oil is also carried. 
If breeding is heavier, it is necessary to 
spread more oil over a smaller area: hence 
heavier pumps holding more oil and throw- 
ing it further are necessary. An illustra 
tion shows a very satisfactory pump for 
such work. When breeding is very intense, 
so that it occurs over several acres, as 
sometimes happens on salt marshes or in 
sewage-contaminated fresh ponds, even 
larger outfits are desirable.

Perhaps the best plan is 
o use kerosene for scattered and small 
breeding places where it would not pay to 
transport fuel oil by the barrel, and to uss 
the latter in places where large quantities 
must be brought from a distance. On ex 
tensive oiling operations it pays to have a 
team carry oil along as closely as possible 
with the pumps.

will not continue unless a constant patrol 
is maintained against local breeding, and 
the ditching systems are kept in repair.

they should be gone over and cleaned and 
all obstructions removed. 

In conclusion, it may be noted that no 
special arguments have been adduced here 
in favor of mosquito eradication—nor is it 
thought necessary. The mosquito is a p 
lic menace and a public nuisance. He ex- 
ists among us solely at our suffrance, and 
is more than time for us to withdraw it.

Preparing for Increased Efficiency in 
Fire-Fighting 


By George W. Booth 


Chief Engineer, National Board of Fire Underwriters 


UNICIPAL 
more important element than that 
of adequate protection against fire. 

In their plans for the coming spring, muni- 
cipal officials will wish to give this subject 
the consideration it deserves; and it is 
hoped that many of them may find practical 
aid in the following suggestions as to fire 
department equipment and personnel, based 
on the experience and observation of the 
National Board of Fire Underwriters. 

In considering the number and location 
of fire companies in any city, considera- 


preparedness has no 


tion must be given fo the topography, 
street paving and general character of the 
city. Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, for exam 
ple, require a considerably larger number 
of companies in proportion to population 
than do some other large cities which have 
not such steep grades and are more com 
pactly built. The introduction of automo 
bile apparatus has offset some of the disad- 
vantages resulting from uneven topography. 
It also influences the number of companies 
through making aid from surrounding com- 
munities more readily available. In this 
last respect it is considered that any needed 
department strength, over that necessary 
for proper local distribution, which would 
otherwise be required to handle a serious 
fire in the congested-value districts, may be 
offset to a large extent by the outside aid 
available within thirty minutes. 

For proper quickness in response it is 
estimated that, with automobile apparatus, 
an engine or hose company should be within 
3%4-mile of every point in high-value dis- 
tricts and a ladder company within 1 mile. 
In residential districts about twice these 
distances will give satisfactory service. For 
horse-drawn apparatus the distances should 
be two-thirds those given above. 

The equipment needed for a department 
is largely dependent upon the topography 
of the city, the character of the buildings 
and condition of the water supply. Where 
the water-works system is so designed as 
to provide an ample supply of water at a 
minimum hydrant pressure during draft of 





75 pounds or over, the fire depar*ment can 
be kept upon a direct hydrant stream basis 
until buildings of over four stories begin to 
be numerous. One or more engines in ser 
vice or in reserve may be desirable to pro 
tect the higher buildings or those too far 
from the hydrants for effective hydrant 
streams. For cities of over 30,000 popula 
tion, it is advisable to have about one-third 
the companies provided with engines, to fut 
nish the more powerful streams Ire 
quently some of the residential sections will 
be at considerably higher elevations than 
the business district, and companies in these 
localities must be equipped with fire engines 

Chemical apparatus should be the mait 
reliance for ordinary fires. In some cities, 
75 per cent or more of the actual working 
fires are controlled by chemical streams 
In recent practice the automobile combina 
tion chemical and hose wagon has been 
found an exceedingly valuable apparatus 
and is largely superseding both the horse 
drawn combination wagon and the straight 
chemical. 

Steam fire engine construction has be- 
come quite well standardized, and _ thes« 
machines have reached a comparatively 
high degree of reliability. However, the 
application of the gasoline motor to fire 
service offers such advantages that in th 
past year or two comparatively few steam 
fire engines have been sold, and many of 
these have been equipped with motor trac 
tors to re place horses. 

The earlier types of gasoline pumping 
engines were adaptations of touring cars 
or commercial trucks. The hard servic 
required of such apparatus in pumping and 
in running over all kinds of roads, often in 
the hands of men poorly trained for the ser 
vice, introduced conditions more severe than 
the machine could withstand. The defects 
developed by these earlier pieces of appa 
ratus are being gradually eliminated by a 
careful design along the special lines neces 
sary for such service. 

In regard to the pump, for all except vil 
lage service two good fire streams should

be available under ordinary working con 
ditions. This, with the modern use of hose 
with smooth lining and nozzles of good size 
and discharging capacity, means an actual 
delivery of about 500 to 690 gallons. With 
all pumping apparatus the slip may be ex 
pected to increase with use, and other con 
ditions will tend to reduce the capacity of 
the pump, so that a capacity of 700 gallons 
is not too much for most cases, and for 
metropolitan service even larger capacity 
may be desirable. City service at serious 
fires, when the maximum engine capacity 
is needed, will most often call for such 
lengths of hose lines and sizes of nozzles as 
to require an engine pressure of 120 to 150 
pounds, with pressure up to about 200 
pounds or more for fires in high buildings 
or for suburban service. 

Various types of pumps have been used, 
and there are a number of different methods 
of connecting the pump to the engine. The 
types in use include reciprocating piston 
pumps, both single and double-acting: ro 
tary cam or gear pumps; and pumps of 
centrifugal or turbine design, either of 
multi-stage or with two or more single-stage 
pumps working in series. Machines em- 
bodying each type of pump have been suc- 
cessfully developed. 

With any type of pump the requirements 
desirable for fire service are flexibility of 
operation—that is, ability to operate over 
a wide range of pressure—and the power 
required for good fire-fighting. The Na- 
tional Board of Fire Underwriters has rec- 
ommended that the test be such as to obtain 
the full rated capacity of the pump for two 
hours against a net pressure of 120 pounds, 
at least one-half of the rated capacity for 
one-half hour against a net pressure of 200 
pounds, and at least one-third the rated 
capacity for one-half hour against a net 
pressure of 250 pounds. 

The ideal equipment for an engine com- 
pany in a city able to afford it consists of 
two pieces, a pumping engine and combined 
chemical engine and hose wagon, the latter 
ordinarily known as a combination wagon. 
A good arrangement in small or medium- 
sized cities is to have about half the com- 
panies equipped as above, which will fur- 
mish adequate chemical service, and the 
other half equipped with combined pumping 
engine and hose wagon. This latter piece 
of apparatus must, of course, be so manipu-

lated at a fire that after the one or two hose 
lines needed are stretched from the hydrant 
to the burning building, the engine will 
reach the hydrant and connect its suction 
as quickly as possible. There will naturally 
be somewhat more delay than if a separate 
engine and hose wagon are provided, but 
this delay should not be more than two or 
three minutes in most cases, even when two 
lines of hose are laid, as shown by tests of 
a crew trained to the work. 

The triple combination, as it is usually 
called by manufacturers, consists of a com- 
bination of pumping engine, chemical tank 
and hose body. Most fire chiefs are agreed 
that this piece of apparatus is not a desir- 
able one for general installation, for the 
obvious reason that its use in furnishing 
chemical service precludes its pumping from 
a hydrant or other source of water supply, 
at least without considerable delay at what 
is likely to be a critical moment; and also 
for the further reason that too much equip- 
ment is carried on one set of wheels and 
is lost to service in case of disablement. 
However, it has a place in localities where 
the pump is very seldom needed—as, for 
instance, in cities where the water-pressure 
is sufficient in most sections for effective 
direct hydrant streams, but where there are 
occasional high elevations or weak spots on 
the water distribution system and the ordi- 
nary hydrant pressure is inadequate. It 
will also take the place of a reserve engine 
for use at serious fires in high-value dis- 
tricts. 

The main points to be considered in pur- 
chasing automobile hose wagons are be- 
lieved to be covered by the recommendation 
included in most of the National Board re 
ports, as follows: 





Automobile hose wagons to have divided 
hose bodies with a capacity of at least 1,000 feet 
of hose when carrying equal amounts of 2'%- 
inch and 3-inch hose. Motors to be capable of 
attaining a speed of 30 miles an hour, and of 
covering 20 miles in an hour over paved or 
macadamized streets having such grades as the 
apparatus is likely to encounter in service. 


Tires and Hose 

Most of the earlier automobile fire appa- 
ratus was fitted with pneumatic tires, and 
some of it is still so equipped; but some 
form of solid or cushion tire has come to 
be considered by most fire chiefs and manu- 
facturers as preferable, from the standpoint 
hoth of safety and economy.

The question of hose is often one requir 
ing considerable argument on the part of 
the chief to convince the city fathers of the 
need of money for an adequate supply. In 
addition to the hose on each wagon in ser 
vice, a complete extra equipment should be 
provided at each house in order that after 
use it may be shifted, cleaned and dried. 
If not used, hose should be shifted on the 
wagons at least every two weeks, in order 
to prevent mildew and the 
lining. 

In case hose is burned or 


cracking of 
otherwise de 
stroyed, or for large fires where wagons 
must come back to reload, the reserve hose 
is also needed. Investigation shows that the 
average hose lines in city fire department 
practice are somewhat over 400 feet in 
length. 
lines, each wagon should carry about 1,000 
feet of hose. For wagons accompanying 
large engines able to pump over 800 gallons, 
or for outlying districts where long lines 
are common, 1,200 to 1,400 feet are better, 
making three ordinary lines or one long 
line for places at a distance from hydrants. 

Good quality hose should have a life of 
about seven years, and annual purchases 
should be made on the basis of replacing all 
every years. That five 
years old should be transferred to the out- 
lying companies, so that in sections where 
a burst line would have 
there will be only new hose. 

The 2%-inch hose is best adapted for 
regular use, but if long lines are laid or 
large streams required, the 3-inch size is 
better. With a standard 1'%-inch fire 
stream flowing, the friction loss in good 
2%-inch hose is 15 pounds per 100 feet 
Thus with 800 feet of 2'%-inch hose, 
pounds pressure is needed to overcome fric 
tion and 45 pounds for the nozzle pressure, 
so the engine must work at 
pounds. If hose is attached to a hydrant, 
the pressure is limited probably to So or 90 
pounds and larger more lines, 
siamesed, must be used to produce a stiff 
stream. Three-inch hose will convey the 
same quantity of water over two and one 
half times as far as 2%-inch hose, with the 
same friction For a standard 1'%- 
inch stream with 800 feet of 3-inch hose, 
only 94 pounds pressure will be needed at 
the engine or hydrant.

friction loss may be still further reduced t 


about one-fourth the loss with a single line. 


In other terms, 108 pounds engine pressure 


will push a 250-gallon 1'¢-inch stream 
through 400 feet of 2 inch hose, or 1,000 
feet of 3-inch hose, or 1,500 feet of 2%-inch 
hose siamesed. Three-inch hose is heavy 
and stiff and not adapted for ordinary us« 
in buildings or on ladders. The best prac 
tice, therefore, is to arrange the hose in 
wagons in two sections so that the 200 to 
300 feet next the hydrant shall be 3-inch, 
and the rest, which may have to be moved

Where 2% and 3 inch hose are in use it 

has been found a great convenience to equip 

the 3-inch hose with 2'%-inch couplings, in 


order to eliminate delays from mislaid re 


ducers and varying couplings. Contrary to 
general impression, the use of smaller coup 


lings does not appreciably affect the friction 


loss, so that for ordinary fire streams the 
difference in pressures from straight 3-inch 
hose or 3-inch hose with 2'4-inch couplings 
is not noticeable. Therefore the National 
Board has recommended that both 2% and 
3-inch hose be equipped with 2%-inch Na

of building standpipes for this purpose, 
either from the lower floor of the same 
building or from a building across a court 
or narrow street, is recognized as being 
good practice, but in addition to this some 
apparatus must be provided for use where 
standpipes are not available. In the smaller 
cities, a ladder pipe attached to the aerial 
ladder gives good service, and if equipped 
with 3-inch hose for the ladder lead, with 
a siamese at the lower end, streams up to 
2-inch can be used, if the ladder is provided 
with a proper locking device. For the 
larger cities a water tower is necessary, and 
in some cities such apparatus is called on 
first alarms; its response should be provided 
for on the running card in every case, and 
frequent drills should be had with it to 
familiarize the men with its proper hand- 
ling. 

Extensive minor equipment is a necessity 
for any up-to-date department; in general, 
most of this is carried on the ladder trucks, 
as it is the duty of the ladder men to use it: 
however, hose wagon equipment should be 
sufficiently complete to permit the men on 
the wagon to work independently of the 
ladder trucks for all residential and other 
small fires. Besides a complete set of noz- 
zles, including both shut-off and open tips 
from 7% to 134 inches in diameter, suitable 
forcible entry tools, chemical extinguishers 
and short ladders should be carried on each 
hose wagon. Ladder trucks and most of 
the hose wagons should carry salvage ap- 
pliances, particularly waterproof covers. 

Repair facilities are necessary for the 
proper upkeep of apparatus, particularly in 
the larger cities where apparatus gets con- 
siderable use. It is better to have this 
handled by the department, and in many 
places all minor repairs are made by the 
men while about the house. A good supply 
of spare parts is becoming of great impor- 
tance with the general use of automobile 
apparatus. To take the place of apparatus 
being repaired, it is necessary to provide a 
certain amount of spare pieces, and this is 
also of greater moment with a department 
equipped with automobiles. It is estimated 
that provisions should be made to have at 
least one fire engine out of ten in reserve, 
with one out of five for automobile pump- 
ing engines; for hose wagons, the number 
in reserve would be one in fifteen and one 
in ten, respectively, for horse-drawn and 
automobile.

Appointment of Officers and Men 

In fire departments, as in other branches 
of city government, political domination 
and petty graft have prevailed at various 
times. It goes without saying that the ap- 
pointment of officers and men for other 
reasons than their fitness for fire service 
will almost inevitably result in demoraliz- 
ing the force and decreasing its efficiency : 
probably the most serious effect is obtained 
when political debts are paid in the ap- 
pointment of chief officers. Only men of 
proven ability should be given important 
positions; in some cases competent chief 
officers of the smaller departments have 
been appointed to similar positions in the 
larger cities, and this scheme has worked 
out well. 

For all officers, long tenure of office is 
desirable, to secure proper familiarity with 
local fire conditions and the general duties 
of the position. To obtain this, as well as 
to eliminate harmful political changes, the 
appointment of all officers for indefinite 
terms, with removal only under charges, is 
desirable. The method of appointment best 
adapted to any city depends largely upon 
the size of the city and local conditions. 
Civil service methods have been in some 
cases rather freely criticised, but it 4s 
doubtful if anything better, or in fact as 
good, could be substituted. Where civil 
service is properly applied, the past record 
of applicants is considered and they must 
successfully pass a rigid physical exami- 
nation before taking the mental examina- 
tions. While the mental examination may 
bar out some otherwise desirable applicants, 
yet in the large cities there is no lack of 
applicants and it is readily practicable to 
make physical requirements such that all 
the men getting on the eligible list shall 
have the making of able-bodied firemen. 
The varied emergencies and requirements 
of modern fire department work are best 
met by men capable of passing reasonable 
mental as well as the physical examina- 
tions, rather than by men whose chief asset 
is mere strength. 

When the eligible list is established, ap- 
pointments should be made by the chief 
rather than by a council committee or the 
mayor, and appointments should not be 
made permanent until the officers have had 
opportunity to observe the work of new 
men at fires and determine whether they 
will make successful firemen. Once ap-

pointed, they should be made secure in their 
positions during good behavior and ef- 
ficient service. 

For retirement, the National Board has 
recommended that members be retired from 
active duty on reaching the age of sixty- 
two years, unless at that time they are un- 
usually efficient. Sixty-two years is the age 
for retirement from the United States army 
and navy. The exemption from this rule 
of members of unusual efficiency enables 
the department to avail itself of the accu- 
mulated experience of the higher officers, 
who should have no manual labor to per- 
form. In connection with requiring mem- 
bers to retire on account of age, there 
should be provisions for pensioning men 
for long service or disability. 

In the ordinary full-paid department, the 
men will be collected in a comparatively 
few companies of sufficient strength to man 
all the apparatus at the station. If call men 
or volunteers are included in the depart 
ment, then enough full-paid men should be 
assigned to get the apparatus to a fire and 
get to work. In a part-paid engine com- 
pany, for instance, the engineer, two 
drivers and one other member, preferably 
the captain, should be full-paid, so that at 
least two men will be on duty during meal 
hours, enough to get the apparatus to the 
fire. For a hose or ladder company, at least 
two men must be full-paid. This does not 
allow for days off or sickness, for which 
permanent substitutes should be employed, 
who will shift from one company to another 
to fill in. 

For a full-paid department, the National 
Board recommends that at least seven men 
be present at all times in each engine and 
ladder company in mercantile and manu- 
facturing districts and five men in other 
districts. For hose companies the men 
should number at least five and three, re- 
spectively. In an engine company the men 
should include one engineer, one officer, 
two drivers and three hosemen. With a 
motor pump only, six men will be required 
as the minimum on duty at all times.

Fire Alarm System 

The fire alarm system has been properly 
called the right arm of the fire department, 
as the promptness and accuracy of its no 
tification largely determine the extent of 
the fire. A brief description of the main 
features is therefore pertinent. 

In 1851 the question of utilizing the in- 
ventions of Morse telegraphy for the 
sounding of fire alarms was taken up and 
apparatus invented by which tower bells 
could be sounded from stations distributed 
throughout the city. The modern fire alarm 
system has been developed from this be 
ginning. The boxes contain clockwork 
which actuates a figure-wheel and is con 
nected by an electric circuit to a head 
quarters or central office. Each box has its 
own number, which is transmitted through 
headquarters to the various fire stations and 
designates the locality of the fire. From 
headquarters, alarms are transmitted either 
manually or automatically. In the former 
case the box number is received by oper 
ators at headquarters and sent out over 
circuits distinct from those containing 
boxes, either by a Morse key or a special 
transmitter. This type of system is best 
suited to large cities where two fires are 
apt to occur at about the same time, or 
where a number of boxes may be pulled 
for one fire; accuracy and speed depend to 
a very great extent upon the operator. [1 


the automatic system, alarms are trans 
mitted, at headquarters, by a_ repeater 
which receives an alarm from a box on one 
circuit and sends it over the other box cir 
cuits, and in some cases over special cir- 
cuits, to the various fire stations without 
manual intervention or assistance. This 
tvpe of system is for use in the smaller 
places, where cost of maintenance is an im 
portant factor and simultaneous alarms are 
infrequent. 

Fire alarm telegraphy is a_ specialized 
subject with which comparatively few en 
gineers are familiar, but one which is at 
the present time receiving a much greater 
degree of attention than it has in the past.

Fire Prevention Work in Asheville, N. C. 


By J. H. Wood 


Chief, Asheville Fire Department 
















WEEK’S inspection of fire waste 

and fire risks has recently been com- 

pleted by the Department of Public 
Safety in Asheville, N.C. The Department 
was ably assisted in this work by three ex- 
perts from Commissioner Young's office at 
Raleigh, N. C., and a flue expert from the 
Underwriters’ Association. 

In the preliminary education of the public 
as to the value of the campaign, Mr. D. 
Hiden Ramsey, Commissioner of Public 
Safety, ran a series of letters and inter 
views in the local papers, which were con- 
tinued throughout the week of the inspec 
tion. During this week our local force, 
together with the assistants mentioned 
above, made a systematic inspection of all 
huildings in the fire district, and also of 
large risks outside of that district, such as 
tanneries, mills, lumber plants, hotels, 
churches and schools, Each school in the 
city was visited by a committee, and on 
every such occasion a fire drill was held for 
the benefit of the outside members of the 
working staff, and a speech—one of a series 
which the Commission had had prepared— 
was delivered by Mr. Sherwood Brockwell, 
of Commissioner Young's office in Raleigh. 
The school children took home cards con 
taining fire prevention rules. 

Commissioner Ramsey has thoroughly 
organized the inspection work. A written 
report of every piece of property was made 
by the inspectors at the time of inspection, 
and the property owner's attention was 
called to any visible defects or risks that 
could be removed. Our Commissioner has 
followed up these inspections with letters to 
the property owners whose premises were 
inspected, thanking those whose premises 
were found in good condition, and in other 
cases ordering the immediate removal of all 
fire risks. A continual warfare is waged 
against improper lighting, defective flues 
and combustible roofing. 

We have a semi-volunteer Department of 
Public Safety in Asheville, made up as fol 
lows: the Commissioner of Public Safety, 
the Chief of the Fire Department, A. L. 
Duckett, Assistant Chief and Electrical En- 
gineer, and L. W. Jeanerett, Secretary. We 
have two hose companies and one hook and 
ladder company, all quartered in a central 


[56] 





station in the heart of the city. The equip- 
ment includes a Gamewell alarm system. 
lhe companies hold frequent practices, and 
the men become proficient in the use of 
Pompeian ladders, life nets and life lines, 
and in the rescue of sick or injured persons 
from buildings. In addition to the regular 
drivers, who are full-paid men, twelve men 
sleep in the fire house at night. All these 
men report to a foreman, who has charge of 
all fires until the arrival of the chief or the 
assistant chief. 


Instruction in the Schools 

The principles of fire prevention are be- 
ing emphasized in instructions given by Mr. 
Harry Howell, Superintendent of Schools, 
to the principals and teachers of the public 
schools. Specific rules for the removal of 
risks and for fire drills are formulated. An 
interesting and unique feature of the public 
school work consists of problems in funda- 
mental operations in integers to illustrate 
fire prevention. The basic problem is: 

The secretary of the Asheville Fire Depart- 
ment reports that during the year 1914 -the loss 
from fires in the city was as follows: those 
due to bad chimneys, $1,432; those due to elec- 
tric wires, $21,840; those due to furnaces, 
$2,545; those due to gasoline and oil, $128; 
those due to flying sparks, $1,816; those due to 
carelessness, $5,075; those due to causes not 
well known, $144,900. Find total value of 
property burned during the year. 


Here are some dependent problems: 


If all the fire loss could be prevented and 
spent for school buildings, and if $175,000 were 
spent on a high school building, how many 
playgrounds could be equipped with the re- 
mainder if it cost $500 to equip each play- 
ground? 

A boy can spend a year at the University of 
North Carolina for $250. There were 189 boys 
enrolled in the Asheville High School last 
year. How long could all of those boys be 
kept at the University with the money lost by 
fires in Asheville? 

For the health and cleaning of the city, last 
year, the expense was about $21,000. The 
total fire loss is how many times as great as 
the total expense for cleaning and health?

The Replacement of Old Style Street

When a city takes up the question oO!

two phase x howev¢ r, cannot be considered 


as altogether se parate proble ms, because one 
depends very much upon the other. The 
object of the lamp post is primarily to carry

as possible. lhe post must be adapted to 
the lamp and to its globe and _ reflector 


equipment; but, on the other hand, the 
globe and reflector equipment must be se 
lected with regard to practicable height of 
post and available methods of cleaning and 
maintaining lamps. The problem of correct 
height and spacing of lamps, and of correct 
equipment of lamps for a given height and

Chis is simply a relic of the 


arc lamp was the only feasible one for street 
lighting; and since many cities thought they 
could not afford are lamps at more frequent 
intervals, they placed them at eve ry othe 
street intersection, where they have re 
mained to this day. Modern lampg permit 
of more frequent spacings. This, togethe1 
with the increased efficiency of modern 
lamps, makes possible enormous increase in 
the amount of useful light on the street. 

Many cities still have what electrical men 
know as the enclosed type of arc lamp. The 
continuation in operation of such lamps is 
an unjustifiable economic waste. The loss 
falls on the taxpayers or upon an electric 
lighting company, or upon both. It is now 
easy to secure lamps and equipment which 
will give, for the same expenditure of 
money, from two to three. times or more 
as much light on the street as these old arc 
lamps. Furthermore, new lamps can be ob- 
tained in a variety of sizes and candle 
power, so that the units can be distributed 
along the street instead of bunched in a 
few large units with dark spaces between. 

A more efficient form of arc lamp which 
has come into use since 1905 is the magne 
tite or luminous are lamp. Many cities aré 
lighted in whole or in part with these lamps 
put in a number of years ago. There have 
been improvements, both in the electrodes

movement, which is now commonly known 
as “white way” lighting of business streets,

for a number of years supported clusters of 
from three to six lamps variously arranged. 
Standard lamp post designs with such clus

many cities, in order to insure uniformity

being replaced in cities where they have 
been installed, but many cities and streets 
taking up white way lighting at the present 
time are adopting these newer one-lamp 
designs 

There is an economic as well as an artis 
tic reason for the one-lamp post. One large 
lamp can usually be secured which is more 
efficient than an equivalent candle power in 
several smaller lamps, and it is cheaper to 
maintain. The initial cost is likely to b 
less for the one-lamp post. In the opinion 
of many it is much more pleasing and dig 
nified in appearance. It lends itself better 


to proper devices for control of th light. 


Some Recent Types of Globes and Standards

A Taxation Revision Movement 

Newark, N. J.—New Jersey has room 
for thousands of new factories and can 
offer to prospective operators the best of 
transportation facilities, with easy access 
to markets. The state has a million acres 
of idle land which ought to be used for 
farming, fruit-raising and gardening. And 
it is said that two million more people 
could make their homes in New Jersey 
without crowding the state. The growth of 
the state is hampered, however, by its pres- 
ent system of taxation, which does not en- 
courage, but rather punishes, thrift and 
industry. 

In order to attract factory operators and 
home-seekers in larger. numbers it has been 
found necessary to revise the taxation laws. 
With this object in view, the Manufac- 
turers’ and Merchants’ Taxation League, 
with headquarters in Newark, was formed. 
It is actively at work advocating legislation 
that will encourage industry, reduce rents 
and make it easier to establish and main 
tain a business or a home in New Jersey. 

The League is urging the exemption of 
machinery, merchandise and household 
goods from taxation, the reduction of the 
tax on buildings and an increase in the tax 
on land similar to the plan adopted in Pitts- 
burgh and Scranton, Pa. It is felt that 
these changes in the taxation laws will not 
only attract industries and people in a much 
larger degree, but will result in retaining 
those that otherwise would be diverted 
across the state line to Pennsylvania, where 
the taxation laws are more favorable.

drafted in the course 
of the conference, to 
be presented to the Senate and House of 
Representatives. In one the desire is ex 
pressed that there be placed at the disposal 
of the United States Office of Public Roads 
a fund of fifty million dollars to be used 
in aiding several states in the construction 
of permanent roads, with certain regula- 
tions and limitations. It was suggested 
that no state receive during any one year 


an amount greater than 25 per cent of the 
total sum which that state and its subdivi- 
sions should appropriate and actually ex- 
pend for permanent road construction dur- 
ing the year. 


It was soon discov 
ered, however, that 
the clubs were not sufficiently well or 
ganized in the various high schools to 
undertake so complete a survey. It was 
then decided to cover as much territory as 
possible in a week’s time, and to have each 
high school club cover the district consid- 
ered its own. The district surveyed was 
larger in population than Milwaukee, and 
included every factor of sanitation entering 
into the affairs of a metropolitan city.

furnished each high school with report

A Paving Celebration 
Des PLAINEs, Itt.—The completion of 


six miles of paving in Des Plaines was th« 
occasion for a formal dedication ceremony 
recently, in which the village officials, who 
are proud of the achievement, sought to 
bring it forcibly to the attention of the citi 
zens. The celebration included an automo 
bile parade more than a mile long, speeches 
by city and road officials, a flag raising, 
and the breaking of bottles of champagne 
on North and South Side Streets. The 
ceremonies were conducted under the direc 
tion of the Village Trustees and the Des 


Plaines Commercial Association. Coroner 
Peter M. Hoffman, a resident of the city 
and one of the most active workers for the 
improvement, was Master of Ceremonies 
Officials from twenty neighboring cities 
were conducted over all the paved streets 
in an inspection tour. . 

The improvements have cost the village 
approximately $175,000, which sum is mac

“Our Most Important Plan for the Coming 
Spring” 


Tue AMERICAN City asked the Secretary of the leading « 
city having (according the 1910 census) a population of bet 
very briefly the most important plan which he hopes his organ 


mmercital rgai If main each 
etween 50,000 and 75,000, f utliny 
ation will carry out during 


the coming spring. The following replies were received: 


For the Consolidation of Thirty- 
three Municipalities 

WiLkes-Barre, Pa.—The special goal of 
the Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Commerce 
for the near future is the consolidation into 
one large city of the many separate muni- 
cipalities surrounding Wilkes-Barre. The 
success of the movement will place Wilkes- 
Barre where it rightfully belongs among 
the commercial centers of the country. 

The city is at present greatly handi 
capped by the fact that the census figures 
do not give an accurate idea of the trading 
and manufacturing population which it 
really has. Wilkes-Barre lies in the center 
of the Wyoming Valley, which is eighteen 
miles long and three miles wide. For all 
of this territory Wilkes-Barre is the trad 
ing center and from it labor can be drawn 
for manufacturing purposes. 

In the Wyoming Valley there are thirty- 
three separate municipalities, each with its 
own borough, township or city government. 
They all have the same water supply, light- 
ing and transportation systems. Within 
this area there was in 1910 a population 
or 245,000, and yet Wilkes-Barre is rated 
as a city of less than 75,000 population. 
The valley has almost the same area as is 
contained within the city limits of Des 
Moines. It will be the special effort of the 
Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Commerce dur- 
ing the next few months to attempt to bring 
about the consolidation of these separate 
communities.

Secretary, Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Commerce. 


Taxation Reform and Building 
Code 


JouNstown, Pa.—Among the five larg 
undertakings which the Jéhnstown Cham 
ber of Commerce has under way for 1916, 
the most important is the campaign for an 
extension of the Somers system of appraisal 
over the seventeen wards in the city that 
are not at present using it 

Next in importance is the campaign for 
a building code. The city has none at pres 
ent, nor is there any public inspection of 
buildings. Consequently builders and land 
owners have been erecting and maintaining 
structures according to their individual 
fancy and inclination. The Chamber of 
Commerce has appointed a Building Code 
Committee which consists of a builder, an 
architect, a lawyer, a doctor, an editor, an 
insurance man and a social worker. The 
committee has asked the Master Builders’ 
\ssociation, the Johnstown Engineering 
Society, the Cambria County Medical As 
sociation and the architects of the city to 
name committees of three men each who 
may cooperate*with the Chamber of Com 
merce committee in drafting a_ building 
code. 

There will be public hearings on the sub 
ject, it being the intention at the first ones 
to demonstrate the need of such a code. 
All the real estate dealers, builders, private 
property owners or others who do not feel 
that such legislation is needed, will be ir 
vited to attend the hearings and present 
their arguments against it. The 


various 

















= THE 


phases of the code will then be taken up 
one by one at subsequent hearings, and a 
building code for Johnstown will be drawn 
up to meet local conditions after a study 
has been made of the laws of the various 
cities in the United States. The code will 
then be presented to the Council, with the 
request that a_ building 
pointed to entorce its regulations.

A Big Bridge Project 


Scuenectrapy, N, Y.—One of the impor- 
tant pieces of work planned for the coming 
months by the Schenectady Board of Trade 
is the promotion of the Great Western 
Gateway Bridge project at Schenectady. 
he undertaking is one of state-wide as 
well as local interest. 

It is proposed to erect a structure run 
ning from the foot of lower State Street 
in Schenectady, across the islands in the 
Mohawk River, crossing the Barge Canal, 
the Mohawk River and over to the high- 
lands of Scotia. This bridge will for all 
time lift the tide of travel above the flood 
conditions which mark every recurring 
spring and will eliminate interruption of 
traffic in the Mohawk Valley. 

The value to any community of a bridge 
connecting different sections and making 
transportation and the shipping of prod- 
ucts easy of accomplishment is obvious. 
Schenectady is looking to the future, and 
the bridge is planned not for the next 
twenty years, but for the next hundred 
years. It will stand at the entrance of the 
Mohawk Valley as a monument typifying 
the progress that has lifted Schenectady out 
of a sleep of two hundred years into a 
wide-awake industrial center.

To Federate Local Charities 


Canton, On10.—The most important plan 
of the Canton Chamber of Commerce for 
1916 is the Federation of the local chari- 
table societies, churches and lodges into a 
so-called welfare body. It is expected that

this action will bring about an improvement 
in the method of handling Canton’s chari- 
ties.

now than ever before, but a coordination 
of the various agencies for helping the 
poor is needed in order to avoid duplica 
tion of work and donations. A complete 
index of the needy families and a housing 
survey should be made. 

The Chamber will first elect a board of 
directors of the welfare body, to be com- 
posed of fifteen persons, five to represent 
the contributors, five the organizations in 
terested, and five some centralized body en- 
gaged in community upbuilding. The plan 
is to have the collection of money for 
charitable work placed in the hands of a 
secretary appointed for that purpose, also 
to use the pledge system for the distribution 
of the funds among the several organiza- 
tions. In the pledge system an agreement 
is reached among the organizations com- 
posing a federation not to expend for any 
one object more than the budget for each 
stipulates. 

The Chamber of Commerce also has in 
mind for the coming year the organization 
of a manufacturers’ and jobbers’ associa- 
tion, with a membership of about 250. The 
Chamber is just completing a campaign for 
a county agricultural agent and expects to 
have an expert in service early in January.

Improvement of Lakes and Their 
Surroundings 


Akron, Ounto.—One of the important 
features of the work of the Akron Cham- 
ber of Commerce during the coming year 
will be to help in securing the further de- 
velopment of the Portage Lakes, a chain of 
five lying a short distance south of Akron. 
The lakes and the land immediately sur- 
rounding them were dedicated as a state 
park by the Ohio Legislature in 1902, but 
their development as such has proceeded 
slowly. 

The Akron Chamber was instrumental in 
securing an appropriation by the state in 
the spring of 1915 for the construction of 
a dam to prevent a recurrence of the havoc 
wrought by the floods of 1913, and also for 
the further development and beautification 
of the lakes. This work is now under way, 
and the activities of the Waterways Com- 
mittee of the Chamber will be devoted dur- 
ing the coming year to having the state

A Few Items From a Big Program 


HarrissurG, Pa.—The Harrisburg Cham- 
ber of Commerce intends to broaden the 
scope and intensity of its work greatly dur- 
ing 1916. One of the ways of accomplish- 
ing this will be through the holding of in- 
spiring luncheon meetings of the sort held 
during 1915. These will be addressed by 
speakers of prominence and specialists in 
subjects of interest to Harrisburg citizens. 

A matter which the Chamber feels should 
be emphasized during 1916 is the growing 
importance of the William Penn Highway, 
the improved state road between Pittsburgh 
and Philadelphia, which soon will be not 
only Pennsylvania’s greatest and most use- 
ful highway, but a nationally famous auto- 
mobile road. The Chamber expects to call 
a William Penn Highway meeting early in 
1916 to center public attention upon the 
highway and create an appreciation of its 
value. 

The compilation and passage of a modern 
building code, with the codperation of the 
city commissioners, will be a feature of 
1916's work. The campaign already started 
to induce merchants and factory operators 
to install automatic sprinkler protection 
against fire is expected to bear much fruit 
during 1916. It is also expected that the 
negotiations now under way to have fire 
insurance risks rated according to modern 
schedule rates rather than local under- 
writers’ “judgment” rates will be brought 
to a successful issue during the spring. 

Coéperation in planning for a new mil- 
lion-dollar high school; efforts to establish 
continuation and vocational work in con- 
nection with the public instruction; the is- 
suing of a guide-book of Harrisburg and 
environs, also of Harrisburg’s wholesalers 
and manufacturers, branch houses and 
other distributors; an improvement in and 
extension of the credit bureau service; co- 
operation with retail merchants in united 


Vor. XIV, No. 1 


seasonal sales; and renewed attention to 

plans for building in Harrisburg a first- 

class, modern hote! are among the many 

other plans for making 1916 the most use- 

ful year in the history of the organization. 
EDWARD L. McCOLGIN, 

Secretary, Harrisburg Chamber of Commerce.

For a More Active Membership 

Terre Haute, Inp—The Terre Haute 
Chamber of Commerce hopes during 1916 
to convince its members and the citizens 
generally that the Chamber exists for the 
welfare of everyone in the community; 
that it is a business organization which is 
endeavoring every day to be of genuine 
service, and that it welcomes suggestions 
from its members and from non-members 
on matters which are of interest or impor- 
tance to them. The Chamber is planning 
to act as a clearing-house where projects 
which have been undertaken in other cities 
may be thoroughly analyzed, and, if con- 
sidered suitable for the community, may 
be at once brought to the attention of the 
people. 

The organization also hopes during the 
coming year to receive the codperation of 
everyone living in the community, and to 
attract to its membership the public-spirited 
people of the city who are interested in its 
development. There is much that the 
Chamber of Commerce can do for Terre 
Haute, but it must first have the support 
of the people, and to gain this the people 
must be made to see that the organization 
is really theirs and that its efficiency de- 
pends upon each individual. 

The object which the Chamber most 
wishes to achieve in 1916, therefore, is the 
thorough welding together of its members 
and their realization that they will receive 
benefit from their connection with the or- 
ganization in proportion to the coéperation 
which they extend, and that if they do not 
make use of the opportunity to reap such 
benefit they will be heavy losers.

A Program of Industrial Devel- 
opment 
Erte, Pa.—The most important work of 
the Erie Board of Commerce for 1916 will 
be the carrying out of the industrial pro- 
gram, the object of which is to knit to- 

















JANUARY, 1916 THE 
gether the various commercial interests in 
the community and work out a plan where- 
by coherent action in the development of 
Erie’s industries may be secured. This 
work must be performed before great in- 
dustrial expansion can be advocated. 

The work was begun in November, 1915, 
by the holding once a week of small group 
meetings at invitation dinners. A manu- 
facturer appointed by the chairman of the 
Industrial Committee each time acts as 
host, and two other members of the com- 
mittee are expected to be present. The 
remainder of the party is chosen from dif- 
ferent lines of business by the chairman 
of the committee and the host of the par- 
ticular dinner. The invitations are sent out 
by the host, and state that the dinner is 
being held for the purpose of discussing 
the industrial problems of the Board of 
Commerce. These dinners will continue 
until June, 1916. 

The various items in the industrial pro- 
gram are as follows: the organization of 
a trade excursion trip; the formation of a 
General Efficiency and Safety First Club, 
the meetings of which are held once a 
month, when debates are conducted; ex- 
cursions to the plants of different manufac- 
turers; monthly competitive articles among 
senior and junior high school classes from 
November, 1915, to May, 1916, on indus- 
trial topics, prizes to be awarded to the suc- 
cessful contestants; investigation and re- 
port on a plan for providing more high- 
type, low-priced dwellings in Erie; inves- 
tigation and report on plans used by or- 
ganizations such as the Board of Com- 
merce, in aiding the smaller local industries 
and in handling applications received from 
new ones; and arranging for a temporary 
or permanent industrial exhibit.

A “Buy-at-Home” Campaign

of the work of the Elizabeth Board of 


AMERICAN CITY 73 


40 


Trade for the spring of 1916 will be a vig 
orous campaign to retain at home all retail 
trade. An auxiliary body of the Board of 
Trade, called the “Home Trade Boosters,” 


has been formed, which conduct the 


will 
campaign. 

A special fund is being raised for pub 
licity purposes. Placards emphasizing the 
reasons why home trade should be fostered 
have been distributed among the mer 
chants, who have placed them conspicu 
ously in their store windows and _ inside 
their stores. 

“Try Elizabeth First” has been a familiar 
slogan in the city for over two years, and 
the present campaign is founded upon this 
motto. Slides reproducing the placards 
will be shown in the moving picture thea 
tres, the proprietors having signified their 
willingness to cooperate in that way. 
Stickers bearing the legend, “Try Elizabeth 
First, Trade at Home, Home Trade Boost 
ers,” will be distributed among the mer 
chants. Large banners will be suspended 
across the three main business streets with 
the words “Try Elizabeth First” appearing 
most prominently. Talks on retail trade 
will be given by experts for the benefit of 
the clerks. 

\ Service Bureau will be organized for 
the purpose of disseminating information 
upon store service, values, deliveries and 
other phases of retail trade. That bureau 
will also take up with individual merchants 
any specific complaints that are made. The 
latter will be done diplomatically and al- 
ways with the intention of correcting faults 
in the system, if they exist. 

Elizabeth merchants have suffered on ac- 
count of the sharp competition with New 
York, only twelve miles distant, and with 
Newark, five miles away. It is the aim of 
the campaign to keep Elizabeth dollars at 
home, and to urge the Elizabethans, when- 
ever making purchases, to “Try Elizabeth 
First.”

Building Up Commercial Efficiency 


The New Cooperation Between the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce and 
Local Commercial Organizations 


By Dr. E. E. Pratt 


Chief ot Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce 


HE Government's work in promoting 
7 foreign trade is centered in the Bu- 
reau of Foreign and Domestic Com- 
merce of the Department of Commerce. 
Many other departments, it is true, cooper 
ate with this branch of the government ser- 
vice and contribute to its efficiency. This 
Bureau has many sources from which it 
obtains commercial data and trade infor- 
mation of all kinds. After this information 
is collected, it becomes the problem of the 
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce 
to distribute it so that the 
will be made of it. 

One of the methods determined upon tor 
distributing this information is the estab- 
lishment of branch offices. The function of 
a branch office, however, is not merely the 
distribution of the information published or 
distributed through the Bureau of Foreign 
and Domestic Commerce, but rather it is 
aimed to establish a service which it is im- 
possible for the Bureau at Washington to 
render. The need which was felt for cioser 
contact with the business community and 
for distributing stations for this trade in- 
formation led, some months ago, to the es- 
tablishment of eight branch offices of the 
Bureau. That these branch offices are fill- 
ing a real want on the part of American 
business men is daily attested by communi- 
cations which reach the Bureau bearing 
tribute to the excellent work performed by 
the commercial agents in charge. 

The necessity, however, for personal con- 
tact with the business community and for 
more detailed and intensive distribution of 
this vast body of trade information is a 
very pressing one. No business man who 
is looking the facts squarely in the face can 
doubt that the United States is facing the 
opportunity of vast commercial expansion 
and that now, if ever, is the time to act. 

Added facilities are absolutely necessary 
in order to effectually serve the business 
community. The Bureau has accordingly 
decided to extend to any commercial or- 
ganization which is willing to subscribe to 
the conditions imposed, exactly the same in- 


[74] 


maximum use 


formation and service as it furnishes to its 
own branch offices. Under this cooperative 
plan it will be possible for any chamber of 
commerce in the country sufficiently inter- 
ested in foreign trade to establish a foreign 
trade bureau and to furnish to its members 
and to the local community the same infor- 
mation in the same form and with the same 
speed that such information is given out hy 
the branch offices of this Bureau. 

Any plan of codperation implies mutual 
obligations. This plan of cooperation in 
promoting foreign trade can perhaps best be 
expressed by the following statement of 
what each side may do: 


What the Local Commercial Organizations 
Are Expected to Do 


(1) The local organization shall establish a 
foreign trade bureau. 

(2) This foreign trade bureau shall be un- 
der the direction of the governing board of 
the organization, which shall be given power on 
behalf of the organization to enter into Such 
agreements as may be necessary. 

(3) The executive direction of this work 
shall be in the hands of a man who shall de- 
vote his entire time to it, and he shall be pro- 
vided with such clerical assistance as may be 
necessary ‘to prosecute his work effectively. 

(4) The work which is being carried on 
shall at all times be open to the inspection of 
the officers of the Department of Commerce. 

(5) The foreign trade bureau shall render 

regular monthly reports of a form to be pre- 
scribed in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic 
Commerce. 
_ (6) The foreign trade bureau shall make at 
its Own expense a complete copy of the “Ex- 
porters’ Index” for its section of the country. 
This index shall be kept up to date and addi- 
tional data transmitted to Washington. 

(7) The foreign trade bureau may be called 
upon to make reports on specified subjects. It 
is understood, of course, that such service will 
not be called for to any considerable extent. 

(8) The foreign trade bureau wiil be ex- 
pected to receive and entertain (arrange con- 
ferences and meetings for) visiting commer- 
cial attachés, commercial agents and consuls 
on leave in this country. 

(9) The service rendered by the foreign 
trade bureau will not be restricted to the mem- 
bers of the organization, but will be freely 
given to all citizens residing in the territory of 
any particular bureau. 



















































































































































































































































































































































































JANUARY, 1916 THE 


What the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic 
Commerce is Willing to Do 


(1) The Bureau of loreign and Domestic 
Commerce will place at the disposal of the 
man who is delegated to do this work every 
facility of its Washington office and its branch 
offices, for purpose of study. This will enable 
him to gain a complete idea of the facilities 
which the Bureau has to offer, and will also 
put in his hands the tools with which to work. 

(2) The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic 
Commerce will furnish the local bureau with 
all the information distributed by it. This will 
include: 

(a) The details and address of 
portunities.” 

(b) Photostatic 
which have been sent heretofore 
of the Bureau. 

(c) All confidential circulars issued by the Bureau 

(d) Telegraphic trade opportunities which have beer 
received by cable. 

(3) Ordinarily the information which the 
Bureau can furnish in answer to an inquiry is 
arbitrarily limited. ‘This is necessary not only 
on account of the great volume of requests, but 
also because of the limited force of the Bu- 
reau. On account of the large number of 
manufacturers who would be reached through 
the local organizations, requests from them 
will receive more detailed and unlimited at- 
tention. 

(4) The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic 
Commerce will furnish each local organization 
with a complete set, so far as available, of the 
publications of the Bureau. 

(5) The Bureau will establish, in codpera- 
tion with the Superintendent of Documents in 
each of the local organizations, a supply of its 
publications which are for sale and which will 
convenience local manufacturers in obtaining 
the desired information. 

(6) All samples which are received by the 
3ureau from its agents in the field will be sent 
to the local foreign trade bureaus for exhibi- 
tion. 

It is contemplated that whenever the local 
commercial organization or the Bureau of 
Foreign and Domestic Commerce desires, 
for any reason whatever, to withdraw from 
this particular arrangement, either may do 
so upon notice. 

In order to show concretely just how 
this plan will work, let us take a specific ex- 
ample. Under the present arrangements, 
if a report is received from an American 
consular officer abroad, accompanied by 
plans and specifications, an announcement 
is made through “Foreign Trade Oppor 
tunities” in Commerce Reports, or through 
a “Confidential Circular” or some other me- 
dium. A manufacturer in Cleveland, for 
example, is interested in this proposition. 
He must, however, write to Washington to 
secure the information, which will take 
from two to four days. Many manufac-

Under the cooperative plan, Mr. Manu

Pennsylvania’s New Continuation Schools 
and Employment Certificates 
By Wallace E. Hackett 


Supervisor of Industrial Education, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 


N view of the fact that the Cox Child 
| Labor Act became effective on January 
1, arrangements have been made to es- 
tablish continuation schools in the school 
districts of Pennsylvania. All minors be- 
tween the ages of 14 and 16 years who 
have working certificates, except those em- 
ployed on the farm or in domestic service 
in private homes, are required to attend. 
These schools must be in session the same 
number of weeks as are the regular schools 
of the particular district. It will be neces- 
sary for each pupil to attend a continua- 
tion school 8 hours per week. He may be 
present a period of 8 hours on one day per 
week and two days of 4 hours per week 
or four days of 2 hours each; or, if thought 
advisable, the instruction may be given con- 
tinuously, provided the total number of 
hours of schooling received by these pupils 
be equivalent to 8 hours per week during 
the school year. 

All the continuation schools must be ap- 
proved by the State Department of Public 
Instruction, in regard to their location, 
equipment, courses of study, qualification of 
teachers and method of instruction, 

The schools may be conducted either in 
the regular schoolhouses or in factories and 
stores. Many of the larger manufacturers 
and merchants have fitted out rooms in their 
establishments as school rooms where in- 
structors from the school department will 
come to execute the work planned. None 
of these schools are permitted to be in ses- 
sion on Saturday or Sunday, nor are they 
allowed to open before eight o'clock in the 
morning or close after five in the afternoon. 


State Aid 

When a school district has fulfilled the 
regulations of the Department of Public 
Instruction, that district will receive from 
the Commonwealth financial assistance as 
stated in the following schedule: 

Each district receives for each teacher of 
class A for the continuation school, $200; 
for each teacher of class B, $150. Teachers 
of class A include all those who have had 


(76) 


three or more years’ teaching experience in 
Pennsylvania; those of class B include all 
those who have had one to three years’ 
teaching experience in Pennsylvania. 
Teachers of both classes must hold special 
certificates to teach in the continuation 
schools. 

Each school district also receives 50 per 
cent of the cost of equipment necessary 
for the academic work and 50 per cent of 
the cost of equipment necessary for the 
variable vocational work; 50 per cent is 
also given to the fixed vocational work. 


Course of Study 


The time devoted to work in the continu- 
ation school is divided in such a way that 
40 per cent of it is given to academic sub- 
jects, thus continuing the general educa- 
tion of the child; 30 per cent to the fixed 
vocational subjects, which are those com- 
mon to the various industries; and the 
remaining 30 per cent to the variable vo- 
cational subjects, the character of which 
depends entirely upon the industries of the 
local community. 

The following outline of work has been 
prepared and sent out by Mr. Millard B. 
King, Director of Industrial Education of 
the Department of Public Instruction. 


ACADEMIC SUBJECTS 


(a) English; letter writing; spelling of 
trade names; reading of semi-technical trade 
articles; writing of compositions on vocational 
subjects. 

(b) Industrial geography; sources and dis- 
tribution of raw materials ; manufacture, trans- 
portation and sale of the finished products. 

(c) Hygiene for the worker; personal hy- 
giene ; community hygiene; safety first. 

(d) Civics; relation of employer to em- 
ploye; local government; state and national 
government, 


FIXED VOCATIONAL SUBJECTS 
(a) Industrial mathematics : 
(1) Arithmetic adapted to the indus- 
tries 
(2) Industrial bookkeeping 
(b) Shop sketching, including freehand 
drawing and mechanical drawing.

VARIABLE VOCATIONAL SUBJECTS

itt which the pupils are employed during the 
day 


New Employment Certificates 

There are two kinds of employment cer 
tificates necessary under the new law: gen 
eral and vacation. General certificates are 
for those boys and girls between the ages 
of fourteen and sixteen who want to work 
the entire year; the vacation certificates art 
for those who want to work only on the 
days when the public schools are not in 
. Besides the working certificates, 
there are many forms that must be filled 
out and filed. 

A boy or girl who wishes to secure a 
general working certificate must first of all 
get a signed promise of work from the pro 
spective employer. This agreement states 
that the employer will give the child a posi 
tion and that the child will be permitted to 
attend a continuation for at least 
eight hours a week. The next step is to 
procure from the teacher of the school the 
child last attended a certificate of scholar- 
ship, which must show that he attended all 
the grades equivalent to six grades of the 
public schools, and has a liberal education 
in the English language, spelling, reading, 
arithmetic, geography and history of the 
United States. 

The teacher also furnishes the child with 
a medical examination card which must be 
filled out by a physician approved by the 
district wherein the child lives. This phys- 
ician thoroughly examines the boy or girl 
and testifies as to his or her physical abil 
ity to do the work selected. Then evi- 
dence of age must be secured from the Bu- 
reau of Vital Statistics of the city or town- 
ship where the child was born. If the Bu- 
reau cannot supply the correct age of the 
child, then a baptismal certificate or a tran- 
script of the record of the baptism may be 
obtained from the pastor of his or her 


session.

Sewage Disposal by the Activated Sludge Process 


An Epoch-Making Dlscovery 


By William B. Fuller 


Consulting Civil and Sewage Disposal Engineer 


ig 
D1 Culbert J Fowler, a d stinguished 
sanitarian of Manchester, [England 
visited the sewage experimental station ot 
the Massachusetts State Board of Health 


{ | awrence, Mass. 
The state of Massachusett as is well 
known, has beet one ot the toremost con 


monwealths in the world in the forwarding 


investigations relating t the pul 
health It has maintained, t great ex 
pense, for the past thirty years or more 


experimental laboratory on all matters 
relating to the purification of sewage and 
trade wastes. As-a result of such studies, 
any of the present methods of ewagt 
disposal have been discovered or perfecte« 
in this station, and it is an authority of 
the highest standing in all matters relating 
to sewage disp sal. 


Mr. Fowler, while at the Station, was 


shown some successful bottle experiments 
n the purification of sewage by bubbling 


air continuously through the sewage. The 
bottles were emptied daily, leaving 
“erowths” sticking to the inside glass, and 
were then refilled with fresh sewage. 
Stable and highly nitrified effluents wer: 
being produced daily. 

Dr. Fowler returned to England, and in 
collaboration with Mr. E. M. Munford, and 
later with Messrs. Edward Arden and 
\. T. Lockett, started at Manchester si: 
lar experiments to those at Lawrence, ex 
cept that they retained the resultant sludge 
formed in the bottle until it occupied about 
one-fourth of the entire bulk of the bottle, 
the clear liquid above being poured of 
every day. After the application of air in 
this manner for about two months, a great 
change was noticed in the sludge: from a 
highly offensive, dark, slimy mass, it be 
came an inoffensive, light, flocculent, dark 
brown mass, spongy and full of air cells, 
which mass settled easily and was easily 
drained. The effluent became clear and

[\NUARY, 1916 THE 
nearly colorless, and almost entirely free 
from bacteria. It was discovered that with 
the presence of this sludge in volume of 
about 25 per cent of the raw sewage, and 
the continuous agitation of the sludge and 
sewage, together with about one cubic foot 
of air per gallon of sewage, purification 
could be speeded up and completed within 
two to five hours, instead of several weeks 
required in the first experiments. 

Thus was born the purification of sew- 
age by the “Activated Sludge Process.” 

The new process is new only in methods 
of application. It has been known for cen 
(uries, for instance, that the blood of the 
living body is purified by contact with air, 
and all of our most successful methods of 
purifying sewage depend on this same prin- 
ciple of intimate contact of air and sewage. 

The old, but successful, method of broad 
irrigation depended on this principle, but 
required so much land that it could not be 
used except in very special and favorable 
cases. The modern sprinkling filter also 
depends on this principle and was devised 
as a method of injecting a maximum 
amount of air into a given amount of sew 
age while occupying as little land area as 
possible. 


Proper Environment Necessary for the 
Multiplication of Bacteria 

The injection of air into sewage is not, 
however, the only requisite for purification. 
It is necessary, also, to provide an environ- 
ment for the growth and multiplication of 
nitrifying bacteria; such an environment as 
was provided by the soil in broad irriga- 
tion, and by the broken stone of the sprink- 
ling filter. In the new process this envi- 
ronment is provided by the sludge itself, 
its putrescible organic matter is removed, 
and the resistant organic matter and min- 
eral matter remain in the form of a sponge 
with millions of pores, providing the neces- 
sary lodgment and environment for the 
multiplication of the nitrifying bacteria 
which are kept active by the continual ap- 
plication of fresh oxygen, and the contin- 
ual stirring of the sludge so as to prevent 
the formation of toxins detrimental to the 
process of purification. 

It is in the provision of an environment 
for the multiplication of bacteria that the 
new process is so much superior to the old 
but similar processes. The sewage pro- 
vides its own medium at no cost, and this 


AMERICAN CITY 


medium, owing to its millions of pores, be 
comes very effective while occupying com 
paratively little space, thus again cutting 
down space and consequently cc st. 

The idea of using mechanical aeration 
in the purification of sewage is not new; 
it was tried in London in the year 1882, 
and was made the subject of extensive ex 
periments in that city in 1884. The Massa 
chusetts State Board of Health experimen 
tal station made extensive experiments in 
1890 and subsequent The late 
Colonel Waring, well known to all New 
Yorkers, made experiments and constructed 
plants in the period subsequent to 1892 and, 
still more recently, Messrs. Black & Phelps 
made extensive experiments in Brooklyn 
on this method in an investigation relating 
to the discharge of the sewage of the city 
of New York into the harbor. In all of 
the above cases, however, no medium was 


years. 


provided for the growth and development 
of nitrifying bacteria, and as a result the 
process was a failure, or only moderately 
successful, in proportion to the bacteria 
which succeeded in making a_ successfw 
and accidental enlodgment. 

The activated sludge method of sewage 
disposal is, therefore, an old and well-tried 
process in a new and modern dress. It is 
a biological process, and such a biological 
process that it must, at all times, be kept up 
to its maximum of efficiency or toxins will 
form which quickly destroy the bacterial 
life. 

The Process is Not Patented 


This process is not patented, but has heen 
given to the world by the scientists of Eng 
land, who first discovered it, and by the sci 
entists of the United States, who have fol 
lowed in the footsteps of their English 
brothers and have gone them one better, as 
the saying is—for the present highest de 
velopment of this process is due to the in 
vestigations made in this country. 

It is not, however, an unmixed blessing 
that this process is not subject to patent 
and under the control of a strong company. 
For a large city, with its salaried staff of 
trained engineers and chemists, it is pos 
sibly best that it does not have to pay roy 
alty in addition to such salaries: but the 
average city of under 20,000 population is 
very apt to believe it cannot afford to hire 
an expert of broad experience to design 
and supervise the construction of such a

have been made show this effluent to be 
comparatively free from bacteria and pu 
trescible organic matter, and in every way 
fit to be turned into large or small streams, 
or, indeed, to be carried away undiluted in 
open channels without any fear of subse- 


quent putrefaction. 


The Sludge as a Feriilizer 


The settled material resulting from this 
process, which we have called sludge, is 
not sludge in the ordinary acceptance of 
the word as now used in sewage disposal 
practice. It generally has a dark brown 
color, is entirely inoffensive, flocculent and 
spongy in appearance, and is much more 
easily drained than sludge from any other 
process. It can be dried easily in the open 
air and shoveled into ordinary carts and 
transported as ordinary moist loam is trans 
ported. In addition to the fact that this 
sludge can be used without offense as a 
filling material, it has come to be recog- 
nized that it makes a valuable fer- 
tilizer, as it contains, on an average, about 
three times as much nitrogen, twice as 
much phosphoric acid, and onethalf as 
much fatty matter as ordinary Imhoff tank 
sludge. This sludge, when dried, resem- 
bles very closely the so-called high-grade 
organic nitrogenous fertilizers, such as 
dried blood and fish guano, rather than the 
low-grade fertilizers made from bone meal, 
cotton seed meal, etc. All experiments 
show that the nitrogen and phosphorus are 
in very available form and very distinct 
from that in the sludge from other pro- 
cesses where the fertilizer value is not in 
a form available for plant life. 

This entire process, both the liquid and 
the sludge, is without odor and inoffensive. 
If the sewage is taken while fresh it is con- 
verted within two or three hours into the 
final product without any odor. There is 
no necessity for the construction of long 
outfalls to isolated disposal fields; in fact, 
such a procedure would be detrimental, as 
sewage flowing through long outfall sewers 
tends to become septic and to give off odors

“Like KELLY Does” 


A Monthly Publication Filled with Motor Truck ~° 
Facts and Figures 


There is an interesting story back of “Like KELLY Does.” It has 
een an important factor in helping us build up a big motor truck business 


It’s different from the ordinary “‘house organ.” It is one of the most 
interesting motor truck publications of the day. It is devoted to facts 
\ und figures regarding Kelly trucks and interesting items concerning motor 

trucks in general 


It will be well worth your time to spend a half an hour once a month 
reading ‘“‘Like KELLY Does.”’ There is a big field for a publication of 
its sort and ‘‘Like KELLY Does”’ is the leader. 

It started three years ago as a four page publication with a circulation 
of 12,000. Our January, 1916 issue contained sixteen pages in color and 
40,000 copies were printed in English and 5.000 in Spanish. 


If you are interested in finding out all you can about motor trucks we 
will be glad to send you “ Like KELLY Does.”’ Your request to be put 
on the mailing list will obligate you in no way. 


May we send you this interesting little book every thirty days ? i

Police Statistics 


TOTAL of 51,045 police officials, 

patrolmen, detectives and civilian 

employes are engaged in the work 
of maintaining peace and order in the 204 
cities in the United States of over 30,000 
inhabitants. Of this total, 5,586 are of- 
ficers, exclusive of detectives, 34,320 are 
patrolmen, 3,303 are detectives and 3,015 
are civilian employes. Of the patrolmen, 
31,294 are unmounted and 1,804 are 
mounted on horses, 708 on motorcycles and 
514 on bicycles. Park policemen number 
248, and policemen detailed at municipal 
buildings and courts, 390. 

New York has 526 mounted policemen, 
Philadelphia 435 and Chicago 186. No 
other city has as many as 100. In New 
York City 135 of the mounted police ride 
bicycles, but Chicago and Philadelphia rely 
entirely upon the horse and the motorcycle. 
Washington, D. C., has 61 bicycle police- 
men—far more than any other city except 
New York, and its total number of mounted 
policemen, 101, is. greater than that of any 
other city except New York, Chicago and 
Philadelphia. 

The highest paid patrolmen are those of 
San Francisco, who are ungraded and re- 
ceive $1,464 per annum; and the lowest 
paid—disregarding those in the lower 
grades in a few cities—are in Williamsport, 





of 204 Cities 


Pa., where patrolmen are ungraded and r 
ceive $756 per annum. 

The longest term of service necessary to 
attain the highest grade is found in Savan 
nah, Ga. In this city the patrolman serves 
five years at $goo, five at $960, and five 
more at $1,020, 


and thereafter 


receives 
$1,080. In Terre Haute, Ind., and Charles 
ton, S. C., the maximum rates of pay 


$1,080 and $1,020, respectively—are reached 
after ten years of service 

Among cities of 100,000 or more, the 
longest term of service necessary to attain 
the highest grade is found in Washington, 
D. C., where, after three years of service 
at $900 and five more at $1,080, the patrol 
man finally receives $1,200 per annum. 

Of police women, Chicago has 21; Balti

going item, there are municipally- 

owned water-supply systems in 155 of the 
204 cities estimated to have 30,000 inhabit-

Park Views in a Montana City 








The park system of Great Falls, Montana, is one of the greatest prides of the city Forethought on the 
part of those who had the city’s welfare at heart is responsible for the reservation of ch land f park 
purposes. The city now owns 17 parks, containing 640 acres, in which are planted 15, trees. Almost as 
many trees are now being grown in the two park nurseries as are planted throughout the entire city, there 
being 45,000 young trees under city care. The boulevards are lined with elm, ash, poplar and other sha le 


trees. The city supervises the parking system along the streets. Under city control are three circular d 
ways: a ten-mile drive to the east known as the Valeria Way; a ten-mile circle to the west through Sun 
River Park; and a four-mile turn to the south over Prospect Hill to the Missouri River and back by way of 
Broadwater Bay. 

It is the aim of the present Park Board to have a park within a ten-minute walk of any part of the city, 
and also a good system of parks connecting the two. Margaret, Whittier and Gibson Parks lie along the 
rivers and are close to the business district, and other parks serve their respective purposes in different parts 
of the city.

BLOOMFIELD, Meyer, Director of the Boston 
Vocation Bureau. 
Youth, School and Vocation. iyi5. 273 
pp. $1.25 
Viewing the education of the child from the point 
{ view of the work which he or she later will be 
alled upon to perform, the book opens with a discus- 
sion of the difficulties in deciding upon a life-work and 
the present-day handicaps in “‘making a start.” These 
observations lead inevitably to a deep sense of the im- 
portance of a rational system of vocational education 
ind guidance. This problem has received much atten- 
tion im Massachusetts, where a Vocation Bureau has 
been established to study the problem and, in codpera- 
tion with the public schools, to work out practical 
methods for vocational guidance. In a chapter de- 
voted to the organization of vocational guidance, the 
ideal working of such a bureau is outlined and in- 
teresting examples of the work of the Boston Bureau 
are cited. Three chapters tell of the progress of simi- 
lar work in England, Scotland and Germany. After 
touching upon the allied problem of health guidance, 
the part played by the school is considered, and a policy 
for the relation of schools to the start in life of their 
children is suggested. In closing, the book states the 
ideals of vocational guidance, and points out how it 
may be turned to the social gain of the community. 
An appended chapter of suggestive material includes 
schedules and questionnaires, records of a Boston voca- 
tional counselor, specimens of vocational talks, ex- 
amples of occupational study and the material used 
for vocational guidance in several different schools.

Official Index to State Legislation: A 
Cumulative Numerical and Subject Index 
and a Complete Record of all Bills Intro- 
duced in all State Legislatures. 1915. 
Quarto. 


This volume represents the first year’s work of the 
National Legislative Information Service, the object 
of which is to furnish a ready reference to all state 
legislation which shall be corrected and cumulated 
each week so as to include all changes in position and 
new bills introduced during the week. The arrange- 
ment of the subject index is (a) by subjects, alpha- 
betically; (b) under each subject, by states, alpha- 
betically; (c) under each state, the Senate first and 
then the Assembly or House; and (d) under each 
House, the bills first and then the resolutions, numeri- 
cally, by introduction numbers. The entry for each 
bill and resolution gives, (1) the bill number, (2) the 
date of introduction, (3) the name of the member 
introducing the bill, (4) the subject, (5) the effect of 
the proposed legislation or the “short title” of the bill, 
and (6) the position or status of the bill, on the date 
shown at the head of the column. The yearly sub- 
scription rate for this service, including the weekly 
numbers and the annual numbers and supplements, is 
$100. Subscribers for 1916 will be furnished the final 
1915 number for $10.00 additional.

Social Service Directory, 1915. 1915. 
250 pp. (As the edition is small, requests 
by individuals for copies should be ap- 
proved by the organization to which they 
belong. ) 


This little handbook is unique in that it is the 
product of the coéperation of Chicago social workers 
and the city’s Department of Public Welfare. This, 
so far as known, is the first effort of the kind. The 
various institutions, bureaus and agencies are ar 
ranged under the appropriate subject headings in 
alphabetical order. Among special teatures are: the 
inclusion of federal, state and municipal agencies; a 
list of community assembly halls; the addresses of 
national organizations; a list of helpful directories; 
the telephone numbers of agencies, and the adoption 
of a special notation indicating which agencies make 
use of the Social Service Kegistration bureau. The 
editorial committee was as follows: Chairman, E. L 
Burchard; Miss Helen M. Crittenden, Superintendent 
of Social Service Registration Bureau; W. S. Rey 
nolds, Secretary, Central Council for Social Agencies

These two reports embody the results of the studies 
and investigations undertaken by Professor Haig for 
the Committee on Taxation of the City of New York. 
The first study outlines existing schemes for the ex- 
emption of improvements in various Canadian prov- 
inces and cities and in five cities of the United States, 
and draws certain generalizations and conclusions as 
to how these schemes affect municipal revenues, ad- 
ministration costs, land values, etc. The second study 
aims to secure from an analysis of the assessment 
rolls for 1914 as much information as possible about 
the probable effects of the adoption of the plan to re 
duce the tax rate on buildings in New York City. The 
various boroughs are taken up separately and the 
effects of the proposed changes are considered in re 
gard to tax rates, distribution of burden among the 
elements of the tax base, and in regard to the effects 
in the various assessment, and certain selected sec 
tions of the borough. Both volumes contain important 
material in the form of appendices.

“Everwear Stands Wear and Tear” 





“EVERWEAR” Roller Bearing Clamps are for mounting swings, 
flying and traveling rings—built to clamp on 2”, 2%”, 3’, 4”, 5”, and 6” 
pipe. Simple but clever—correct in design and construction. 

We give you an “inside’’ view. As the load sets this in motion and 
it swings back and forth, you notice what happens to the clamp? The 
bearings ROLL—they obviate friction—they increase the enjoyment of the 


device and prolong the life of “Everwear”’ apparatus. This is 
just one of our so-called “little } things’’ to which we have given 
careful attention like all the others. Prices if you ask for them. 





“Sliding Down Our Cellar Door’’ 


SLIDE CHUTES 


The old cellar door is here commercialized and brought up to date. Children will 
climb and slide somewhere, somehow, and we here offer a device that is complete in 
detail and consistent with safety. 


Stairs are equipped with perforated steel treads, and handrails run the full length 
of stairs. Oceans of fun, and action is continuous. Fully described in Catalog C-3

For all types of paving, for concrete bridges,

allowance must be made for expansion and 


contraction, ELASTITE saves time, labor and 


expense and gives a better job. 


ELASTITE consists of a heavy body of 
special asphalt compound between two layers 
of high-grade asphalt felt, the whole being 
firmly bonded together to form a continuous 
section of any desired dimensions. 














Instead of using wooden spacing strips and then, 
coming back to remove them and pour the 
joints, merely place ELASTITE strips and 
leave them, thus keeping your work all in front 
of your gang.

A STRIKING 


Accident Prevention Signs 


The conservation of human lives and re- 
sources is the largest question to-day before 
the human race. Carelessness, haste, speed, 
top production, lack of organization, are caus- 
ing great loss of human life in this present 
generation; it is no heat of human passion, n 
desire for world conquest, such as is evidenced 
by the Great War—our sin is more one of 
greed than anything else. Safety and the re- 
duction of this fearful toll are now admitted to 
be a matter of education—of system. This is 
where the importance of signs enters. It is an 
easy matter to advise the employe and the pub 
lic of the existing dangers (and danger cannot 
be eliminated from our complex life), but it is 
quite a different matter to keep that employe 
or member of the public constantly reminded 
The right kind of signs will do that, or very 
largely help to do it. One must go further 
than using merely printed words on a steel 
plate or on a board: signs should be symbolic, 
should be made and worded so as to stand out 
from the general scenery and have the quality 
of attention-getting. They should also be so 
universal in their adaptation and use as to be 
generally recognized from coast to coast and 
border to border. A danger sign in Maine 
should look and mean the same as one in any 
other part of the country; and so through all 
the list of signs which can be used to such ex- 
cellent purpose. One can hardly believe that 
this question of signs has a scientific side, but

A Handbook of Civic 
Improvement 
HERMAN G. sei J.D., PH.D. 


Associate Professor of Government, Director of the Bureau 
of Municipal Research and Reference, University 
of Texas. 


Price, Paper, $1.00, Postpaid 


This book represents a new departure in the field of 
municipal literature, not only in that it concerns itself 
almost solely with municipal functions instead of with 
municipal organization, but especially in that it attempts 
to make the information contained in the text immediately 
available for purposes of civic improvement. This is done 
by adding at the end of each chapter dealing with one of 
the main municipal functions, a question sheet which can 
be used as the basis of a city survey in that particular 
field by readers of the book. The different functions dis- 
cussed are Public Health (three chapters), Public Safety, 
Public Education, Public Morals, Social Welfare, and 
City Planning. 

Such a book is eminently fitted for use by all sorts of 
civic organizations in practical improvement work, and is 
especially valuable for the citizen who wants to know 
what is to be expected of an up-to-date city government. 
it is intended, however, also for use as a sort of laboratory 
guide in college classes in municipal government, which 
are inclined to be too theoretical and abstract in their 
study of municipal matters. By its use the students can 
be put to work investigating actual conditions in their 
college community and be in a position to direct effective 
survey work nny they return to their own municipalities.

ribbed construction, combining rigidity with 
least weight. The entire arrangement and the 
finish are such that there are no sharp corners 
in which dust may collect and be practically 
non-removable, and there are sufficient clear- 
ances so that a cloth may be passed through 
and the instrument thoroughly cleaned or dried 
in a few minutes. The waterproof feature of 
the compass box and the vernier glasses makes 
it unnecessary to take the instrument apart in 
any way after using it in the rain. 

This instrument is described and illustrated 
in a pamphlet issued by the makers, which also 
gives some interesting information about the 
use of the special Gurley transit in the con- 
struction of the Hell Gate bridge, New York 
City.

An Inexpensive Street Lamp 

An attractive booklet, called “Little Broth- 
ers of the Sun,” deals with the lamps made by 
The Coleman Lamp Company, Wichita, Kan. 
One of its most interesting features is the 
Coleman arc lantern as used for street lighting, 
especially in small places. This is a gasoline 
lantern, holding two quarts and burning 25 
hours on one filling. It uses two mantles, is 
said to have perfect ventilation, and is sold 
under a guarantee to give satisfactory service 
in any weather. The accompanying illustration 
shows a support that can be made at small cost 
by any blacksmith, and which can be attached 
to a post, a telegraph pole or the corner of a

A Vacuum Street 
Cleaner 
The dirt most difficult 


to remove from paved 
streets is the fine dust re- 
sulting from traffic. The 
street flusher and the 
vacuum street cleaner ap- 
pear te be the most satis- 
factory agencies for re- 
moving such accumula- 
tions. The photograph 
herewith reproduced 
shows the vacuum street 
cleaning machine manu- 
factured by W. E. Bax-

This. cleaner sweeps a 
width of 12% feet, and 
is driven at a speed not 
to exceed 4 miles an hour.

The Use of Slag in 


Concrete Bridges 

Readers of THE AMERICAN City will be in- 
terested in an additional regarding the 
concrete bridge across the Cuyahoga River, on 
the state road between Akron and Cleveland, 
Ohio, pictures of which were published in the 
Town and County Edition for November, 1915. 
An important fact, to which the attention of 
engineers, architects and contractors should be 
called, is that slag was used as the aggregate 
in the concrete of which this bridge was built. 
The design of the bridge was prepared by 
Wilbur J. Watson & Co., bridge engineers, of 
Cleveland, and approved by E. W. Paul, County 
Engineer, Summitt County. McArthur Bros. 
Company, of New York City, were the build- 
ers, and George L. Ehrman was the resident 
engineer.
