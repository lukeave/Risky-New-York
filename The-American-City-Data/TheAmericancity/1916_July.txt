Municipal Golf 


A Widespread Form of Public Recreation 


Some Suggestions for Instituting 


and Supervising It 


By Tom Bendelow 
Golf Architect, Chicago, III. 


EW people have any idea of the extent 
F to which the gospel of outdoor exer- 
cise has appealed to the various park 
bodies throughout the United States. All 
the movement needed was a start, and after 
some of the members of a park board in 
one of the large cities in the East were 
made aware of their privileges as well as 
their responsibilities in the matter of giving 
the people the use of what belonged to them, 
the march onward has been steady. 

It has been the writer's privilege to visit 
many park commissioners during a period 
of twenty-odd years—all on the subject of 
setting aside space in public parks for rec- 
reation purposes. The attitude of some of 
them—and I am glad to say they were the 
exception—was entirely antagonistic, and 
then only because they did not know. They 
were in no wise backward in expressing 
themselves as opposed to the use of the 
parks for such a purpose, believing that 
golfers had no right there whatever, that 
golf was a rich man’s game—that they were 
not in sympathy with anything of the kind, 
in short. 

We had the privilege of explaining to 
some of these sticklers that their point of 
view was wrong. Some of them pointed 
with pride to the beautiful horticultural ef- 
fects obtained in many parks and to the 
many miles of beautiful that had 
been built, asking if it was true that they 
had done little for the public at large. We

tried to show them that all this work of 
obtaining beautiful effects was really done 
for the cultured had_ the 
esthetic taste to appreciate such things; that 


classes who 


the miles of fine roads which they had built 
through the parks could be used only by 
the wealthier people who had equipages i 
which they could ride, and that the artisan 
and his family were really not looked after 
at all. The keep-off-the-grass signs for- 
ever barred them from utilizing the great 
open spaces in public parks for recreation, 
and should a man 
come into a park and the children attempt 
to play ball, the brave defender of park 
rule, if true to his oath of office, would have 
to stop them. Coupled with this was the 
fact that the ordinances of all cities made 
ball-playing in the street a misdemeanor- 
so that the youth of our large cities had 
little opportunity to follow the impulse to 
play. As was explained to these park com- 
missioners, it was really up to them to see 
to it that opportunity was given to the great 
mass of people, both young and old, to exer- 
cise their prerogative on that which be- 
longed to them—the public parks. 

The more liberal-minded of park commis- 
sioners have been quite willing to give the 


poor with his family 


matter a good deal of consideration, and 
the result has been far beyond our most 
sanguine expectations. New York and Bos- 
ton were the first large cities to take up the 
question, and with their action as a begin-

ning the movement has spread throughout 
the country. There is now hardly a town 
of any size in the United States that is not 
alive to its responsibility as to the use of 
public parks—that has not come to a reali- 
zation that one of the best means of keep- 
ing young boys from vicious places is to 
provide means for their following their bent 
as to recreation. 


The Extent of Public Golf Playing 

Golf courses in playing condition are now 
found in the public parks in New York, 
Boston, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, 
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Indianapolis, 
Chicago, Milwaukee, Memphis, Elgin, Rock- 
ford, Racine, Wis., Danville, IIL, Des 
Moines, Peoria, New Orleans, Omaha, Kan- 
sas City, St. Louis, San Antonio, Los An- 
eles, San Francisco and Seattle, and other 
cities throughout the country are contem- 
plating establishing this feature of public 
recreation. Many of the smaller cities 
have not yet secured municipal golf courses, 
but this is generally on account of lack of 
room, not because of antagonism on the 
part of their park commissioners, as it was 
twenty years ago. The development of 
playgrounds has done much to relegate 
keep-off-the-grass signs to the dump-heap. 

Probably the city that has done the most 
to provide accommodations for golfers is 
Chicago—and we must remember that all 
other forms of wholesome outdoor sport 
are taken care of wherever the game of 
golf obtains. In Chicago there are six pub- 
lic golf courses, two of which are 18-hole 


courses, and the other four 9-hole courses.

no exaggeration to say that probably a mil- 
lion people take advantage of what the park 
commissioners have given them, and young 
and old can often be seen starting out to- 
gether for a round on the course, which is 
certainly a tribute to the advantages to be 
derived from the use of these facilities. 

The city of Elgin, Ill, is probably the 
smallest municipality to maintain a public 
golf course. If one feels any misgivings as 
to the value to the public of what the com- 
missioners of Wing Park, in Elgin, have 
done, all it is necessary to do is to take a 
trip out there and see for oneself. From 
early morning till late at night the course 
is crowded—so much so that rules have 
been adopted to regulate the play. 


The Benefits of Golfing 

The advantages of this sport over all 
others are readily apparent. In a baseball 
game you see eighteen athletes participat- 
ing, while, it may be, thousands look on. 
tf the day should happen to be a raw one 
the onlooker is certainly liable to catch a 
severe cold, which may incapacitate him 
from work for a while or have more se- 
rious results. The same is true of many 
other games, but with golf the conditions 
are entirely different. Few people care to 
watch it, and those few are really the de- 
votees of the game; consequently the vast 
majority play—young as well as_ old, 
women as well as men. It takes them out 
in the open air, giving them all the walking 
they want, for in accomplishing a round of 
18 holes they will cover at least six or seven 
miles. Think of the form of exercise they 
are getting—the swinging of the arms, the 
greatest invigorator for a sluggish liver— 
and all the time out of doors, breathing 
pure ozone, while as a mental relaxation 
there is nothing to beat it in the wide world, 
for it takes the mind from everything else 
and centers it on what one is doing. 

The implements used in playing the game 
are now produced at such reasonable cost 
that they are within the reach of all, and, 
with the courses maintained at public ex- 
pense, there is no reason for the average 
citizen’s being without this form of exer- 
cise because he cannot afford it. 


Regulating a Public Golf Course 
Golf courses in public parks under city 
control can be made much more advantage- 
ous than they have been up to the present 


time. Park commissioners should foresee 
this one thing—that they should secure the 
greatest good for the greatest number 
“Safety first” should be one of the most 
important requisites in the laying out of a 
golf course. One thing there should not 
be in a public course, in my opinion, if this 
end is to be achieved: that is, water hazards 
of lagoon type, which are nothing more or 
less than a means of congesting a golf 
course. Hazards should be of very sim 
ple nature, and not of such character as 
to impede progress; in the latter case it is 
impossible fora public course to be as well 
regulated as a country club course. A 
country club has its membership, who are 
well educated as to what a golfer’s duties 
are to himself as well as to the other 
players; consequently there is very much 
more consideration shown for one another. 

On a public course, where everyone 
thinks he has as much right as another to 
do what he jolly well pleases, it is impos- 
sible to regulate the players after they have 
left the tee. I have seen three or four 
players, belonging to different parties, in a 
bunker, playing for the same hole, and when 
remonstrance was made by those who sup- 
posedly had the right of way, they were 
politely told to mind their own business. It 
will ever be thus where new beginners are 
coming on to the course every other day, 
and for that reason I believe the fewer haz- 
ards there are the better will be achieved 
the results for which the park boards are 
looking. The fewer short holes there are 
in a public course the better, and then they 
ought not to be of such a hazardous nature 
as to cause congestion; if they are of such 
a character, you again defeat your own 
ends, the course being “all gummed up” at 
that particular point. The public courses 
are also a means to an end; they are the 
nurseries of the country clubs and the golf 
clubs, and, as their players gain proficiency 
and advance in business affairs they will 
seek affiliation with golf and country clubs. 
The game of golf has a wonderful fascina- 
tion for people, and it is something that 
holds. 


Laying Out the Course 
Public golf courses should be not less 
than 6,500 yards long where possible. 
Ground of a slightly undulating nature 
should be secured. The less planting of 
trees and shrubbery indulged in inside the

course the better. There are usually plenty 
of opportunities for the landscape architect 
to get in his work outside the precincts of 
a golf course, but when a landscape archi- 
tect has anything to do with a project of 
this kind, he too often makes the golf 
course subservient to his architectural de- 
signing. This, I believe, is altogether 
wrong. The golf course architect is the 
man who should be first considered in this 
matter, and if, after he has finished his 
work, there are opportunities for decora- 
tive treatment, they will be so apparent as 
to leave no doubt as to how and where 
they should be used. 

I believe it wise that these matters should 
come under the authority of the park de- 


drive and a brassie. A longer hole could 
then be added, followed by a short hole; 
the fourteenth should complete all the short 
holes on the course. Of course these dis- 
tances are arbitrary, and the nature of the 
ground and its extent should determine 
these points for the one who is mapping 
out the course, but these suggestions will 
give some idea of the course that will give 
the greatest good to the greatest number. 


The Details of Management 


I do not believe that any fee should be 
charged on a public course. The park 
boards receive their share of public taxes, 
and appropriations ought to be made for 
the maintenance of the golf courses as well

partment, which is more in touch with the 
subject than is any other of the civic 
bodies. The department should be as will- 
ing to pay for expert advice along this line 
as along any other line upon which it seeks 
assistance. 

In laying out a public course, I believe 
it is well to take the whole extent of the 
property by going around it just as far as 
possible to begin with, not bringing back 
the ninth hole to anywhere near the start- 
ing point, but allowing that to be as far 
from the first tee as you can. Put the first 
hole at such a distance as to take care of 
as many players as possible—say about 440 
yards; the next one at about 390 yards, the 
third at about 550 yards; the next hole 
could be from 150 to 226 yards, then of 
various lengths up to, say, the tenth hole, 
extending from a drive and a mashie to a 


as for the maintenance of any other de- 
partment of the public parks. Baseball 
players who take advantage of the dia- 
monds in the public parks do not pay any 
charges for their privilege; why should 
golfers? There is no reason in the world 
for it that I can see. 

Custodians should be appointed to look 
after the conduct of the course, seeing to 
it that rules are put up in conspicuous 
places, so that all who run can read. There 
ought to be an employe whose duty it should 
be to start the people off in entire accord- 
ance with the rules of the game. I believe 
park boards have made a mistake in the 
past by appointing to such positions men 
who do not know the first thing about the 
game and its requirements, and who there- 
fore are unable to give to the matter the 
attention which their position demands.

ON THE MUNICIPAL GOLI 
Clubs and Tournaments 

The writer was one of the organizers of 
the first club on a public golf course, and, 
in fact, helped to organize golf clubs on the 
first public course laid out. The minute 
this was done certain people who did not 
join these organizations raised a hue and 
cry, claiming that the golf club members 
would be seeking all sorts of favors from 
the park board when tournaments were go 
ing on. Such a thing was never dreamt of, 
however; the writer, coming from Scot- 
land, and having learned the game on the 
municipal links in that country, knew full 
well that no such favors could be granted 
and that none would be asked.

Protecting School Children from Fire 








The following articles, based on papers presented at the recent 
annual convention of the National Fire Protection Association, are 


of especial interest at this vacation season, when opportunity is « 


{- 


fered to prepare for the greater safety of school buildings during the 


coming school year. 


Planning School Buildings for Safety 


By C. B. J. Snyder, F. A. I. A. 


Superintendent of School Buildings, Board of Education, N. Y. 


HE planning of a school building from 
T the standpoint of safety to the occu- 
pants and from destruction or even 
serious damage by fire, would be compara- 
tively simple if we might adhere to the one- 
story fireproof building located upon a large 
plot of ground. Each school room might 
have its own direct exit out of doors, and it 
would be immaterial, so far as safety is con- 
cerned, as to how many school rooms there 
might be. 

There is, however, not only a practical 
limitation from the administrative point of 
view as to the area which such a building 
might cover; but we also have the ccntrol- 
ling factor of economics, which precludes 
the construction of this type except in 
sparsely settled or outlying sections of a 
city. 

Height alone does not prevent their being 
planned for safety as to occupants and the 
practical elimination of the fire hazard. 
Because of the stair climbing involved, 
however, I am not in favor of constructing 
school buildings of more than four stories 
in height. 

The increase in cost between the fire- 
proof and non-fireproof type is continually 
being lowered, due to improvements in 
methods and materials, so that under nor- 
mal market conditions the authorities in 
every community, whether large or small, 
should refuse to authorize the construction 
of non-fireproof school buildings. 

In this they will have the support of the 
people, if there be placed before them the 
fact that in the erection of a _ properly 
planned fireproof public school building, 


there is not only a guarantee as to the 
safety of the investment, but also, which is 
of greater importance, the absolute peace 
of mind as to the security of their children 
in attendance. Moreover, the difference in 
cost will be largely offset by the reduction 
or elimination of fire insurance charges; and 
by the annual saving in the cost of repairs 
and maintenance. 

Careful planning will first of all take into 
consideration the number, and 
width of stairways. The number will be 
fixed by the total capacity of the building 
which must use stairways for exits. 

Our practice has been to estimate stair 
requirements on the basis of 15 square feet 
per pupil for all rooms or spaces used for 
academic or other instruction. 

We have found that the highest standard 
of service is obtained with a stair 4 feet 
in width for an elementary school and 5 feet 
in width in buildings used for high schools 
or other form of occupation. 
provides for not more than 
abreast, each with a hand rail. 

All stairs, except perhaps those forming 
the main entrance, which should not extend 
above the first story, should be enclosed 
with fire- and smoke-proof materials 
throughout, access to the enclosure being by 
means of self-acting kalamein doors. The 
stairways should have a sufficient capacity 
to permit all of the occupants vacating the 
building in not more than three minutes in 
a non-fireproof structure and not to exceed 
three and one-half minutes in a fireproof 
building.

basement, where exit is had, should open 
into the stairway following the line of flow 
of pupils. At the first story, or basement, 
they should open out toward the exit gate. 
All exit doors should open out. 

Exits should be planned on the basis of 
stair service and such further capacity as 
circumstances might seem to demand in 
order to prevent crowding or congestion. 

Nothing has yet been devised which could 
entirely overcome the involuntary periods 
of hesitation on the part of either children 
or adults in passing out of a building. 

This may be due either to the innate cau- 
tion which one exercises in stepping out of 
doors, or to the difference in the intensity 
of light, but whatever it may be, it must 
be reckoned with where exits are to be 
used in emergencies. 

In the case of older buildings, of which 
nearly all are non-fireproof, it may not be 
feasible to make much change in the plan; 
but conditions cannot be considered as sat- 
isfactory unless the requirements as to stair 
capacity, construction and enclosure, to- 


gether with exits, be carried out precise ly 
as planned for a new fireproof building. 

An outside fire-escape should not be built 
save as a last resort, as, for instance, when 
it is found impossible to construct a propet 
stairway within the building. It should 
then correspond as nearly as possible, in 
width of steps and height of risers, to the 
stairs which the pupils are accustomed to 
use, 

The cutting off of all communication be- 
tween the furnace or boiler rooms and that 
part of the building used by the pupils 
should not be overlooked, as well as the 
safeguarding about all steam and hot air 
pipes and the closing off with fireproof ma 
terials of all vertical openings. 

This list can be easily lengthened by any 
one familiar with the conditions, but it is 
not too much to say, in considering the plan- 
ning of school buildings for safety, that we 
should give the greatest attention to the 
making safe of those of the old types which 
have been the cause of such awful loss of 
life. 





The Care of School Buildings 


By S. A. Challman 


State Commissioner of School Buildings, Minnesota 


HE primary factors that enter into the 
care of a building are the plan of 
the building and the materials of 

construction, the mechanical equipment and 
the janitor service. 


Janitor’s Room and Storage Room 

It goes without saying that in order prop- 
erly to care for a building, the means 
whereby it is to be accomplished must be 
at hand. On this account there should be 
in all except very small buildings several 
small storage and supply rooms with shelv- 
ing and other provisions for utensils neces- 
sary for the care and maintenance of the 
building. A garret or general storeroom 
which invites the accumulation of rubbish 
is a poor substitute for several small rooms, 
as the janitor is apt to use such a room to 
store material which should either be 
promptly repaired or else carted away. 
One of the rooms should be furnished with 
a desk so that the janitor may have a place 
where he can check up the materials which 


he handles, and record such data as may 
be required of him. He should also have 
facilities for keeping catalogues and liter- 
ature pertaining to supplies which are 
placed in his charge. He has no need of 
a storeroom for broken furniture, as this 
should be turned over to the manual train- 
ing department for repair or disposed of at 
once. Architects can aid materially in the 
care which their buildings subsequently re 
ceive by planning in each case one well- 
lighted supply room and office for the jani- 
tor, and several other smaller rooms for 
storage purposes only. None of these stor- 
age rooms should be located under any 
stairway. 


Fireproof Construction 
It is gratifying to note that there has 
been during the last decade an appreciation 
on the part of architects and an endorse- 
ment on the part of the public of a plain 
and simple trim of rooms, which in large 
measure does away with dust-catching and 

















easily ignited surfaces and renders the

commendable feature, since it tends not 


only to safety but to neatness and cleanli 


ness as well. The durability of freproot 
material makes the war against dirt and 
decay an easier and much more satisfactory 
campaign to wage. The use of such ma

be overemphasized, since it is vastly better

lhe third way is to install fire-fighting 
apparatus. to the 
unused hose and reel in a number of build- 
ings, and, in considering the likelihood of 
its use by the occupants of the building at 
the time of fire, we are, I think, well-nigh 
of the opinion that it hardly justifies the 
cost of installation and upkeep. 


We have become used 


Chemical 
fire extinguishers respond sooner and give 
quicker results. The unwinding of the reel 
and the turning of the valve are apt to deter 
those seeking safety from the attempt to 
use the apparatus, while the inverting of 
the chemical extinguishers is so rapid and 
easy a process that hardly anyone would 
hesitate about taking the chance of using 
the apparatus, if he is strong enough to 
handle it and it is placed within easy reach. 
The size and location of these extinguishers 
in school buildings are matters of careful 
consideration, as a heavy extinguisher 











Jury, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 13 


would have no one within reach who could 
use it in case of a blaze. The extinguisher 
for a school should be of a type which any 
woman or twelve-year-old boy can handle 
with confidence. 

Far in advance, however, of any other 
method of fighting schoolhouse fires and 
insuring the safety of children, is the auto- 
matic sprinkler. There can be no argument 
as to the desirability of its installation, as 
the very principles upon which it is con- 
structed are based upon good common sense 
and a sound application of scientific knowl- 
edge. The proper care of a building re- 
quires that the basement, stairway, corri- 
dors, and space for heating plant and fuel 
room be equipped with this form of fire 
protection and that laboratories for manual 
training, cooking and chemistry, and stor- 
age rooms for paints, oils, paper and other 
inflammable material should be similarly 
protected. No building. is as safe with any 
other form of fire protection as it is with 
the automatic sprinkler. The fact that it 
can be as readily installed in an old build- 
ing as in a new one is a further reason for 
urging its installation in all school build- 
ings providing for one hundred pupils or 
more. 


Intelligent and Constant Janitor Service 

The largest factor, however, in the care 
of a building is the janitor service. Aside 
from fires due to lightning, or fires which 
originate in the roof, nearly every other 
fire discloses upon subsequent investiga- 
tion that it might have been averted if 
the janitor service had been constant. Both 
at Collinwood and at Peabody the janitor 
was temporarily absent when the disaster 
took place. Neither man was in any way 
to blame for being absent. It was not ex- 
pected of these men any more than it is 
of thousands of other school janitors that 
they should remain on the job. 

No matter what buildings we get or what 
equipment we install, human negligence can 
defeat ordinary precautions for safety. It 
is, therefore, of the utmost importance that 
the school: janitor be a man of intelligence 
and integrity. The same characteristic ap- 
plies to other men in the school building, 
employed as engineers or firemen. The 
responsibility for lives and property which 
rests upon these men is not always looked 
upon as seriously as it should be by the pub- 
lic or by school boards. Too often cheap 








men are employed, and, in most instances, 
if an investigation were made, these men 
would be found exceedingly expensive. In 
a high school building in a thrifty city of 
10,000 in Minnesota, where the scale of 
wages is rather conservative, the engineer 
for 1914-15 was hired for nine months at 
$65 a month. For the present year an en- 
gineer is hired for twelve months at $70 a 
month. The superintendent of the school 
reports that by the first of January this 
year the new man had saved $725 in fuel 
over what it cost for the same period the 
preceding year. During vacation he will 
overhaul the entire mechanical equipment 
and put it in shape for efficient service. In 
this particular school there is a scale and 
a steel car which holds half a ton of coal. 
No coal is used unless it is first weighed 
out. The engineer, fireman and janitors of 
this building work according to a schedule 
which requires their being at certain tasks 
certain hours of the day, and while school 
is in session the janitors must be on duty. 


The Importance of Cleanliness 

Cleanliness and safety are closely asso- 
ciated. In a certain small school which | 
used to visit annually in the capacity of 
state school inspector, | found for several 
years in succession a janitor who white- 
washed the walls of his boiler room, as 
well as the boiler plant itself, several times 
a year. On one occasion when I ques- 
tioned him as to the reason for this, he re- 
plied that he always kept the walls white, 
as it enabled him to see and remove dirt. 
If all janitors took the same precaution to 
see dirt and then remove it we should prob- 
ably not continue to burn ten school build- 
ings a week, as we are now reported doing. 
If floor sweepings, papers, oily waste and 
other rubbish from the laboratories and 
school rooms were put into metal safety 
cans and the contents of the cans burned 
daily, there would not be much of a chance 
for any sudden blaze, when no one hap- 
pened to be around. If manual training 
rooms, chemical laboratories and cooking 
rooms were equipped with metal or other 
fireproof containers for inflammable mate- 
rials and the proper kind of housekeeping 
was practiced at all times, a schoolhouse 
fire might become as strange a phenomenon 
as Halley's Comet. 

I want to emphasize the personal element 
and call for a high grade of men for janitor

service. The compensation in too many 
places is not adequate, and the facilitie 

for the improvement of the service are 
practically unknown [There are some 
courses offered in trade schools for jani 

tors, but they are not popular, owing to thi 

small remuneration and the uncertainty of 
continued employment. What we need, I 
think, first of all is summer courses for 
janitors and would-be janitors, and then a

We need men who know what responsibil- 
ity means and who accept it. We must 
have men with sterling characters and men 


who love children. At the same time we 
must have the wages of which the laborer

cured, their retention should be encour-

The Charter Fight in Springfield, Mass. 


By C. O. Dustin 


Manager, Springfield Bureau of Municipal Research 


PRINGFIELD has finally been per- 
mitted by the Massachusetts Legis- 
lature to vote on the question of a 

new charter. At the state election this No- 
vember the voters will express their prefer- 
ence between a city manager charter and 
one in which a highly responsible mayor is 
the chief administrative officer. Of thes¢ 
two proposed forms, the one which re- 


ceives a majority vote will be placed upon 
the municipal ballot in December, and thx 
voters will be called upon to choose between 
it and the charter now in operation, fifty 
years old and extremely complicated. 
This opportunity for citizens’ expression 
on the charter question comes after six 
years of agitation by the people of Spring- 
field for a new charter. The first of recent

lot that the Legislature could be induced by 
constant lobbying to pass the’ bill. 

During the citizens’ efforts to place the 
bill before the Legislature and to have it 
acted upon favorably, opposition to charter 
reform has been shown by members of the 
City Council and by others connected with 
or friendly to the present city government. 
This hostile attitude makes it clear that a 
strong citizens’ organization and a broad 
campaign of education will be necessary to 
secure enough interest at the polls to defeat 
the politicians who desire to continue un-

The New Conception of City Planning 


{From an editorial in the Reading, Pa., Herald| 


It is a good thing to be reminded that 
city planning is no idle folly, but the habit 
of a majority of well-ordered cities. The 
expert of to-day is getting a more patient 
and ardent hearing than we used to accord 
to experts who came this way. We derided 
them as visionaries, as foes to our wealth 
and disturbers of our peace, as interlopers 
and upstarts. What right had any one of 
these to cross our threshold, seeing that 
neither they nor their grandfathers had 
been born in Berks? 

Sut time at last makes all things even, 
the poet has it. 


as 
Those who used to sit in 
the scorners’ seats and stand in the way of 
non-progressive sinners are marching in 
the ranks of the optimists now. They are 
progressives for fair. They want a better 
city, and they have awakened to the fact 
that the only way to get one is to plan for 
one and then to carry out your plans. 
There used to be a general impression 
that whatever faults there were in Reading 
—and few of us were ready to admit that 
there were any at all; to do so would be 
high treason—were directly blamable upon 
a well-meaning but sometimes fallible 
Providence. The fact that we had typhoid 
fever sometimes, that measles were period- 
ically rampant, that many of our children 
died very young, and that our streets were 
ragged and muddy and rocky and rutty was 
all ascribed to the inscrutable ways of the 


world’s Creator. Likewise the fact that we 





had no back yards worth speaking of, that 


bath tubs were scarce and few, that our 


vacant lots were reeking with filth, and that 


trolley rates were high and the service 
poor. 
To suggest that these things might be 


improved upon was sacrilege For it indi 
cated a lack of faith in the goodness of 
Providence. We must be patient and en- 
dure these things—measles and mud and no 
bath tubs 


the rest. 


and narrow back yards and all 
For were not they sent us by 
Deity that could do no wrong? 
hardly any. 

The city planner of to-day takes a rather 
different view of the situation. He thinks, 
in common with most city planners, that it 
is wicked and irreverent to let 
down at the heels and let the babies die 
young and let disease smite us hard and let 
things go to topsy-turvydom and thereupon 
blame it all on the Giver of every good gift. 
And the people are coming to share that 
view.

AN EXHIBIT OF COMPARISON OF FOOD VALUES. SHOWN IN 100-CALORIE PORTIONS 








THE 


JuLy, 1916 


As most people are interested in objects 
or things, rather than in abstract ideas, the 
subject of the food requirement of the 
family, the relative value to the body of 
different foods, znd the need of variety in 
diet for growing children, are taught by 
a collection of foodstuffs. On one table are 
one hundred calorie portions of all our 
common foods, put in jars plainly labeled to 
show their protein, fat and carbohydrate 
content. Above these jars are these gen 
* eral titles, accurately descriptive, but easily 
understood by the people: “Foods which 
help to keep the blood right and build 
bones”; “Foods which make your muscles 
grow” (the protein group); “Foods which 
give you lots of energy to work and to play” 
(the fats and sugars), and “Vegetable foods 
which keep you warm and give you energ) 
to work and to play” (cereals, etc.). A 
bottle of water bears the card, “Water helps 
keep the blood right—drink six or eight 
glasses of pure water every day.” An 
eager group of boys and girls exclaimed to 
the demonstrator: “Why, you have milk in 
nearly every group, and eggs and potatoes.” 
“Yes, that shows they are very good foods 
to eat every day.” On the wall above is a 
chart that shows the quantity of each com- 
mon food which can be purchased for ten 
cents (the buying capacity of many cus- 
tomers). This is compared with the cost of 
one pound and of one package of the same 
staple foodstuffs; for there are three 
methods of buying: “Give me ten cents’ 
worth”; “I'll take a pound, how much is 
it?” and “Send me a package.” 

A table bearing the legend “Lowest food 
allowance for a family of five” has upon it 
a duplicate of the week's allowance fur- 
nished to families by the Relief Department 
of the A. I. C. P. Here is enough to eat 
and of the right kind. Hanging above this 
table are menus which show how to utilize 
the food provided.

the different races to America, emphasize

Municipal Preparedness for Peace 


Cities After the War 


(From the New Brunswick News) 


In view of the peace discussions, which 
take on something more of realism daily, it 
is time that American cities began to look to 
their affairs should a cessation of hostilities 
The great industrial and manufac- 
turing centers must not be caught unawares, 
and it is very evident that the commercial 
adjustment which will be forced upon us 
inevitably will catch us napping unless wise 
forethought, and not unreasoning fear, dic- 
tates an immediate preparation. 

Tue American City, a publication de- 
voted to municipal problems, social, indus- 


come, 


trial and commercial, suggests two plans 
which all municipalities should adopt as 
three-year programs: first, the continuation 
of normal purchases, regardless of the war 
and the carrying on of new work to meet 
immediate needs; second, the installation of 
improvement on an exceptionally large 
scale after peace has been restored. 

In the matter of commercial prepared- 
ness—which is, after all, as vital as mili- 
tary preparedness—the business men of the 
nation will do well to give the suggestions 
serious consideration. Such a program 
would have substantial results: It 
would promote the cause of municipal prog- 
ress, and it would go far to offset the losses 
to capital and labor which might otherwise 
occur soon after a return to peace.

City of Olean, N. Y. 


To the Editor of Tue AMERICAN City: 


Referring to your recent editorial on Mu- 
nicipal Preparedness for Peace, | beg to 
advise that plans for the future are receiv- 
ing more than ordinary consideration in 
this city. 

The belief is quite general that, should 
any temporary business depression follow 
the close of the European war, it can well 
be counteracted locally by progressing 
needed improvements that will not have to 
be paid for until long after such period 
has passed. 

Work on a half-million-dollar river im- 
provement project in this city has just be- 





gun, and a study is being made of a com- 
prehensive reclamation scheme consisting 
of dredging and back-fill to be undertaken 
through the cooperation of owners of lands 
affected after the dike construction has 
been completed. 

Through the river improvement work, 
Olean comes into possession by gift of 
nearly a hundred acres of park lands, much 
of which borders upon the principal streets. 
The plans for the work now under way pro- 
vide for the filling and parking of these 
lands, thereby transforming them from eye- 
sores to beauty spots. 

The new water-front is so designed as to 
give nearly three miles of boulevard along 
the picturesque banks of the Allegheny. 

A study is being made of the city’s bridge 
needs, with a view to connecting recently 
built-up subdivisions with the old city. 

Highways leading to the city are being 
paved 40 to 50 feet wide. A special effort 
will be made toward the development and 
beautification of lands adjacent thereto, so 
as to give to the visitor the best possible 
first impression of the city. 

We are in hearty accord with your pro- 
gram of Municipal .Preparedness, and bhe- 
lieve Olean is entering upon an era of in- 
creased activity along the lines of com- 
munity betterment. 

The City Council and the Chamber of 
Commerce are working harmoniously in the 
interest of the whole city. As a result, a 
splendid public sentiment exists which 
makes for industrial peace and general pros- 
perity.

To the Editor of Tue American City: 

I have read with much interest your edi- 
torial appearing in the May issue of Tue 
AmeErIcAN City, entitled “Municipal Pre- 
paredness for Peace,” and am frank to say 
that you have touched the keynote of a very 
important situation which confronts many 
municipalities of the size of my city, Cor- 
dele. 

Since assuming the duties and respon-

people the importance of inaugurating a 
campaign of preparedness, along all lines 
which would in my judgment prove of last- 
ing benefit to the welfare of the city. Dur- 
ing the past two years this city has rebuilt 
its water station plant, installing new and 
modern machinery, constructed a_ rein- 
forced concrete water tower 150 feet in 


height, with a capacity of 500,000 gallons, . 


and a ground reservoir with a capacity of 
250,000 gallons, thereby giving a water re- 
serve ample for a city three times the size 
of Cordele.

tion of a municipally owned and operated 
electric light and power plant, to be con- 
structed in connection with the water plant,

Districting by Ordinance in Sacramento 
By Frank J. Mulvihill 


MONG the city planning problems of 
Sacramento, that of building districts 
or zones for industrial, business and 
residential purposes is important. Dr. John 
Nolen, city planner of Cambridge, Mas: 
who is retained by the City Commission, in 
his preliminary report to them on the city 
plan, recommended: 

“That city ordinances should be passed fixing 
by authority the zones or building districts of 
the city Chis should be done not merely to 
safeguard residential districts from unneces 
sary depreciation, but also to enhance values 
in districts set aside for industrial and busi- 
ness use, and thus enable the city authorities 
to provide more adequately for the dispatch of 
business in these districts.” 


The accompanying illustration shows the 


main thoroughfares of Sacramento: Heavy 
black lines, existing traffic ways; heavy dash 
lines, proposed connections. There are 
three main zones. (1) industrial, shown 
by double-cross hatching; (2) business, sin- 
gle-cross hatching, and (3) residential, left 
blank. 
1—The Industrial Zone 


The industrial zone embraces 
where the land values are low and satisfac- 
tory for industrial use; good railroad con- 
nections exist or can be secured by short 
sidings ; proximity to the water front offers 
opportunity for river transportation. Few 
industries are at present 
the zone represented.

water supply, power, fire protection and 
Street lines can be suca

blocks, since many industries require such 
provision. 


2—The ‘Business Zone 

The business zone indicated embraces 
the area now used for this purpose and pet 
mits of reasonable expansion. The land 
values are highest in this section now, ond 
will rise, no doubt. There are only two 
buildings seven stories high and two build 
ings more than seven stories. That build 
ing heights will be regulated is a safe as 
sumption, and Dr. Nolen suggests that six 
stories would be high enough. This district 
will receive from the city services which ar 
peculiar to such sections; for example, good 
street lighting, better handling of traffic, 
and transportation facilities. 

local business centers in the residential 
sections will be established and controlled 
by ordinance of the City Commission after 
the people in the immediate locality have 
deemed such centers necessary. In the il- 
lustration business frontage has been pro- 
vided in a neighborhood center. The cen- 
ter includes open spaces and parks with the 
grouping of public and semi-public buildings 
around these open spaces at an important 
street intersection. Such intersections will 
occur at about one-fourth mile intervals. 


3—The Residential Zone 

The residential zone will be for that use 
only. It may be divided into various classes 
to provide sections for tenement and apart- 
ment houses, for example. It will be ob- 
served that near the industrial zone ar 
portions of the residential. This land is 
of a low value, and being near the indus- 
tries is quite suitable for the location of the 
houses of the workers. Regulation and 
control by the city of the subdivision of 
property will be given careful study and 
then applied. Blocks in the old city were 
repeated after the gridiron plan. In the 
sections beyond the old city the subdivisions 
also have not developed along lines em- 
bodying the principles recognized as good 
city planning. Studies of typical blocks ex- 
isting for the greater part showed that lots 
had too little street frontage. When the 


Vor. XV, No. 1 


bungalow type of residence, characteristic 
of California, and having most of the ac- 
commodations on one floor, is built, crowd- 
ing of the residences results. This entails: 
the sacrifice of privacy, a diminution of 
light and air, an added risk from fire, and 
the loss of beauty in the architecture of 
the street itself. Instead of lot widths of 
40 feet or 50 feet, 80 feet is proposed as a 
minimum, when the long dimension of thx 
bungalow parallels the street, and 60 feet 
is suggested for bungalows when the long 
side is at right angles to the street. The 
lots need not be quite so deep; 120 feet 
might be considered as the maximum. 


Classification of Streets 


A classification of streets into main thor- 
oughfares, secondary streets and minor 
streets, each having a roadway of sufficient 
width to accommodate their requirements, 
will avoid repetition of loss experienced 
within the old city boundaries. Says Dr. 
Nolen’s report: 

“More than 50 per cent of the area of the 
old city is taken up in streets and alleys 
Thirty per cent would be a liberal allowance 
for a city of the character of Sacramento 
rhis means that at least 20 per cent of the 3,000 
acres of the old city, or about 600 acres of 
the most valuable land in Sacramento, is wors« 
than wasted. These 600 acres would give the 
city many streets 100 feet wide for transpor 
tation purposes, double the number of plazas 
at present, three or four blocks for a liberal 
civic center and at least two blocks for each 
public school. Furthermore, it would reduce 
the cost of upkeep many thousand dollars a 
year, save time in transit for both people and 
goods and increase the income of the city from 
local taxes, because more property could b¢ 
used productively.” 

The establishment of the three zones in 
Sacramento has been based on the study of 
the past, present and the probabilities of 
the future. Such studies concern, for ex- 
ample, local conditions of land values, of 
use of land, of extent of use, of building 
permits, of building operations—both actual 
and tendencies—and of the distribution of 
population. Actual details of control are 
being evolved so that each district will 
have restrictions worked out that will best 
serve the peculiar needs of that district. 
The character of each district will be con- 
served; existing and future investments 
will be safeguarded and an appropriate and 
orderly building development for Sacra- 
mento will be encouraged. 














Standard Units for Comparing Municipal 
Improvements 





A Paper Read Before the Seventh Annual Meeting of the New York State Confer- 
ence of Mayors and Other City Officials 


By A. Prescott Folwell 


Chairman, Committee on Standard Forms of the American Society of Municipal Improvements; 
Editor of Municipal Journal 


ISTORY states that the Indians sold 
to the sons of William 
given sum an area of land extend- 

ing northward from Philadelphia for such 
distance as a man travels in a day's jour 
ney; and said sons, not being as square in 
their dealings with the red men as their 
father, hired a famous runner, in perfect 


Penn for a 


training, to measure out a day's journey, 
thereby profiting greatly at the expense of 
the Indians because of the indefiniteness of 
the unit used in the measurement. 
Centuries earlier it was the practice in 
Kuropean countries to use as a unit the 
length of a man’s foot, and men with long 
feet were in great demand as official meas- 
urers. But the fact that feet varied so in 
length led to countless disputes, and finally 
an English king measured the foot of a 
popular local standard, cut a bar of metal 
to that length (304.8 millimeters), and es- 
tablished that as a legal standard for the 
country. China did the 
same thing, but one section adopted a foot 
98 per cent as long as England's, another 
section one 109 per cent as long, and China 
to-day has these two standards. The Ar- 
gentine Republic foot is 95 per cent of the 
Knglish (which is also ours). The 
used as a unit in Spain and the 
\merican countries, but there are 


Two sections of

nine dif 
ferent varas, varying from each other by 
as much as 4 per cent. 

The disadvantage of this lack of uni- 
versal standardism in units is very real to 
those who have dealings with foreign coun- 
tries or study their reports and records. 
Sut these differences are as nothing com- 
pared to those between the local standards 
employed by cities to measure the various 
details of their public works. In fact, the 
dollar is about the only definite standard 


we have for use in comparing these. 


Estimates and Costs 


lo the majority of city officials and tax 


payers the one thing most readily undet 


stood about public work is its cost. Even 
engineers, to whom the technical and con 
struction sides of such work are those of 
most interest, must also consider cost

erally a perfectly valid one; but the mere 
fact that explanations and excuses are 
necessary is apt to arouse suspicion, espe- 
cially if there is anything indefinite about 
those given. How much better if explana- 
unnecessary, or if, when re- 
quired, they could be made so clear and 
concise as to convince any man of average 
intelligence. 
~~ 

Why taxpayers may have an excuse for 
asking explanations, and why engineers 
may have difficulty in making estimates 
based on costs, may be made more clear by 
a few illustrations. In reply to inquiries 
made this year and last by the paper of 
which I am editor, several hundred city 
engineers furnished figures giving the aver- 
age costs to their cities of each of the 
various kinds of pavement. From the fig- 
ures furnished for New York state, I have 
selected those shown on the accompanying 
table.

Or take brick pavements. In 1915 Dun- 
kirk laid these for $1.39 a square yard, 
while Troy paid $2.85—more than twice as 
much. Syracuse paid $2.05 in 1914 and 
$2.37 in 1915, an increase of 32 cents; while 
Salamanca paid 36 cents less in 1915 than 
in 1914, or $1.89 as compared with $2.25. | 
have no figures for Buffalo for 1915, but 
she reported for 1915 a cost of 3.20 for 
brick pavement, nearly two and a half 
times as much as Dunkirk, and $3.53 for 
asphalt, or nearly three times as much as 
Geneva. 


W hat is ‘‘Paving’’? 

One thing is sure—there was not act- 
ually all this difference in costs, and it is 
evident that these figures are for some rea- 
son not comparable, that the thing which 
Buffalo calls paving is not the same as that 
to which Dunkirk applies that name. And 
what Syracuse did for $2.05 in 1914 was 
not, I believe, the same as that for which 
she paid $2.37 in 1915. 

As Buffalo is the most “horrible exam- 
ple,” let us see what she paid $3.53 for in 
1914. It included, beside the pavement, 
some grading, setting new curb, laying a 
drain, probably other general work like re- 
setting manhole heads, and a ten-year guar- 
antee. Another city, not in this state, has 
gone far ahead of this, however, for she 
includes under the head and price of pav- 
ing all excavation, curb, storm sewers, ad- 
justing manhole heads, building catch ba- 
sins, and even grading the private property 
along the street. I see no reason why that 
city did not include lighting standards, wire 
conduits, shade trees and other street ac- 
cessories, except that perhaps they - were 
already in. 

All these things are street improvements, 
but they are not paving, and to call them so 
seems absurd. Moreover, to explain that a 
certain cost includes grading and setting 
curb does not help us to compare this cost 
with another: it only shows that such com- 
parison would be useless unless we know 
just what part of the cost was to cover 
each of the non-paving items. 

The total cost of these non-paving items 
may be considerable. For instance, in 1915, 
Walden, N. Y., laid a brick pavement which 
cost $1.84 for the pavement and foundation, 
but $2.34 if excavation and other improve- 
ment items be included. This is an average 
and not an extreme case. In some cases 











Iury, 1916 THE 
the additional items will amount to 
more than the paving. 

It may be claimed by some cities that un- 
der their methods of assessment the prop- 
erty owner is to be assessed for the fotal 
cost of the improvement, and therefore this 
is the cost desired. ‘This is all right if you 
call this street improvement and not pav- 
ing. But even in this case, itemizing costs 
is of great value, as will be shown in a 
minute; and if the cost were itemized, a 
school boy could get the total cost per front 
foot in five minutes by a little multiplica- 
tion and addition; while if the bids or rec- 
ords give only the total cost, not even a 
paving expert can “unscramble the eggs” 
and tell what the paving alone cost. 

Some prefer a “lump sum” bid, so that no 
extras can be worked in on the payment. 
But the same end can be reached by re- 
ceiving itemized bids, and adding a “resid- 
uary item” clause, asking a price for all 
work necessary to complete the job accord- 
ing to plans and specifications, but not cov- 
ered by the other items. 


even 


Itemizing Bids and Costs 


The advantage of having bids or costs 
for each item is, I think, apparent with a 
moment's thought. If we know what it 
costs each city in the state or in the coun- 
try to lay a square yard of standard brick 
pavement, exclusive of excavation, curbs 
or any other items, then we have figures 
which are directly comparable. We can 
tell whether neighboring cities really did 
get more for a dollar than we did. We 
can show the taxpayers, without dubious 
explanations that they are getting more for 
their money this year than they did last. 
If A complains that his street improvement 
assessment is higher than that of B, who 
lives on the next street, we can show him 
that it is because there was more grading 
to be done on his street, or more curb to 
be set, and that the paving itself does not 
cost him a cent more. The probability is, 
however, that the facts will appear so plain- 
ly in the published figures that we shall not 
need to explain at all. 

In the previous remarks, paving has been 
used for illustration, but the same ideas 
apply to sewer construction or any other 
kind of public work. It is only when costs 
are itemized that cost records of such work 
will be of value for making future esti-

Standard Units 

If the only aim is to compare costs in 
your own city and on work done by you 
individually, then each man might 
his own units for measuring and express- 
ing quantities of work. But 
more valuable his cost records would be 
if he could compare them with those of 
all other cities and of previous administra 
tions in his own city! This means that he 
and all others should use the same units 
that when he says “a square yard of asphalt 
pavement” he means exactly the same thing 
as every other man who uses the term. 

A very considerable number of cities do 
keep their records and receive their bids 
itemized as described; but they find the 
undoubted value of this is lessened by the 
fact that not all use the same units for 
measuring the work done, or use them with 
exactly the same meaning. 

To remedy this condition, the American 
Society of Municipal Improvements has, 
after two or three years’ consideration, 


select 


how much 


adopted a few of the more important units 
for paving and sewerage, which it recom- 
mends as standards for universal use. This 
society numbers among its members most 
of the leading city engineers and consulting 
engineers on municipal work, and it is to 
be presumed that the units which it adopts 
will be those best adapted to the purpose 
which seem practicable at this time. The 
standard paving specifications which the so- 
ciety has prepared are now generally ac- 
cepted as the standards for the country, and 
it hopes that its standard units also will be 
generally adopted. When each standard 
kind of pavement is laid by everyone ac- 
cording to a standard method

these units so satisfactory as those which 
they are now using. But the general adop-

would be a great improvement over the 
present condition of no man understanding 
just what another means. And that the

Let Us Have an American Letchworth! 

An American garden city, planned by ex- 
perts, financed on a limited dividend basis, 
and offering the most nearly ideal condi- 
tions for commerce, industry and_ labor, 
would be an object lesson of tremendous 
importance in American municipal prog- 
ress, 

Such a model city is suggested by Thomas 
Adams, Town Planning Adviser of the 
Canadian Commission of Conservation, in 

paper published in this issue. This was 
the basis of an address delivered a few 
weeks ago before the Biennial Convention of 
the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, 
in New York. In it Mr. Adams urged that 
the women’s clubs interest themselves in 
helping to finance such a project. Whether 
the idea shall be taken up by public-spirited 
women or men—or by both, as would prob- 
ably be preferable—Tue AMERICAN CIty 
is convinced that the money could be raised 
and that the job is well worth undertaking. 
As Mr. Adams well says: “To plan and 
build a combined industrial and residential 
city de novo is a fascinating thing; and to 
make it an economic success is to save a 
generation of talk about theory.” 

Believing that the financing of an Eng- 
lish garden city would offer valuable sug- 
gestions for a similar project in this coun- 
try, we have asked Mr. Adams for a state- 
ment of the latest figures of the “First 
Garden City, Limited,” as the Letchworth 
corporation is called. Such a report was 
published in January of this year, and from 
Mr. Adams’ analysis of it the following 
paragraphs are quoted: 

“The total liabilities of the First Garden 
City, Ltd., for share capital, loans, interest, 
etc., amount to $2,986,535, as against which 
there are the following assets: Freehold prop- 
erty, including land, building, highways, water- 
works, gas works, sewerage, electrical power 
station, parks, open spaces and boulevards, 
etc., as per independent valuation, $3,054,035. 

“The difference between the above figures 
represents about $67,500, being the net bal- 
ance of the revenue and expenditure accounts 
for 1914 and 1915. These were the net profits 


available in these two years for dividend, but 
no dividend was paid in view of ‘the financial 
situation created by the war.’ The main dif 
ficulty in securing financial success of this 
garden city has been the inadequate amount of 
capital available in the form of ordinary 
shares to enable the directors to properly 
push the development of the estate. In the 
first two or three years a great deal of execu- 
tive work of the company had to be devoted 
to raising capital instead of building up the 
productive side of the enterprise, and after a 
propaganda spread over twelve years less than 
$1,000,000 has been subscribed to conduct a 
project which should have had at least $3,000,- 
ooo to carry it through successfully. The 
company is severely handicapped by the large 
amount of interest which has to be paid on 
borrowed capital, now amounting to about 
$50,000 per annum. This interest has always 
been regularly paid. Although the company 
only started in 1911 to make any net profit 
after seven years at work, the nature of its 
operations has been such that a_ different 
result could not have been expected unless the 
company had been prepared to pay dividends 
for a time out of capital. The net profit has 
increased since 1911 from $870 to $29,110 in 
IQ15. 

“The character of the undertaking, as shown 
by the succeeding figures, will indicate that 
although the company is slow in making 
profit, it is rapidly building up a very valuable 
asset for the shareholders. The following 
are the figures for 1904 and 1915: 


1904 1915 
Number of new buildings........ 26 2.160 
Estimated value of new buildings $60,000 $3,330,000 
Land revenues created per annun 205 36,820 
ROOD DOCNRME 3 <cccvcccvceccece 21,535 250,075 
Population (estimated)....... ha 400 12,000 
Number of manufacturers...... 33 


“The output of gas in 1915 was 69,000,000 
cubic feet; electricity, 907,000 B. T. units; 
water, which is supplied from artesian wells 
pumped to an elevated surface reservoir, rep- 
resented an output of 99,000,000 gallons, be- 
ing a little over 8,200 gallons per capita, or 23 
gallons per day. 

“This company has expended most of its 
money in actual development of land—that is, 
on water-supply, sewerage, road making, light 
and power supply, etc. Its limited capital has 


prevented it from conducting building opera- 
tions on a sufficient scale to take full advan- 
tage of opportunities that have arisen. The 
remarkable thing is that, in spite of its being 
an entirely novel experiment and conducted 
with entirely inadequate resources, it has 
been such a success. That success is not to be

measured by the amount of the profit. When 
it is conside red that the Site, which has cost 
for development a total of $3,000,000, has upon 
it buildings of a value of over that amount, 
that there are 12,000 people living and 33 fac- 
tories established on the land, and that the 
company possesses control of all the public 
services and has alienated none of its land 
owning rights, it will be seen at once how 
valuable a concern it has built up. If it de 
sired to be entirely commercial, it could no 
doubt sell its rights at a profit which would 
both pay the ordinary shareholders their accu- 
mulated dividends and leave a handsome protit. 
“In another garden city the mistakes that 
have been made in this case could be avoided, 
with the chance of great savings being ef- 
fected. If land could be obtained at some- 
thing approaching its agricultural value, and 
two or three manufacturers could be induced 
to transfer their factories to the site acquired, 
no doubt there would be very little chance of 
failure of such a scheme, subject always to 
sufficient capital being available, according to 
the size of the town proposed to be built.”

Regulating Street Planning 
by Boards of Survey 

By Chapter 190 of the General Acts of 
Massachusetts, approved May 10, 1916, the 
cities of that commonwealth ave authorized 
to appoint “boards of survey,” having ar- 
bitrary powers over the planning and loca 
tion of streets and ways. These boards, 
when appointed, are to consist of three citi- 
zens, the city engineer to act as clerk of the 
board. Section 2 of the act reads as fol- 
lows: 


Section 2. Any person, firm or corporation 
proposing to lay out, locate, relocate or con- 
struct for public use, any private street or way 
in a city after the establishment therein of a 
board of survey under the provisions hereof 
shall, before opening such street or way for 
public use, submit to said board suitable plans 
and profiles of the street or way, so pregared 
as to show also the method of drainage of the 
adjacent or contiguous territory, all in accord- 
ance with such rules and regulations as the 
hoard may prescribe. Upon the receipt of the 
said plans, with a petition for their approval, 
the board shall give a public hearing thereon 
after giving notice of the same by publication 
once in each of two successive weeks in a 
newspaper published in the city, the last publi- 
cation to be at least two days before the hear- 
ing: and after the hearing, the board may 
alter such plans and may determine where 
such streets or ways shall be located and the 
width and grades thereof, and shall so desig- 
nate on such plans. The plans, as approved or 
modified by the board, shall then be signed by 
the members of the board, or by a majority 
of them, and filed in the office of the city 
engineer, who shall attest thereon the date 


min a ee 


Vor. XV, No. 1 


of filing; and thereafter no street or way in 
the territory to which the plans relate shall be 
laid out or constructed except in accordance 
therewith, or with such further plans as may 
subsequently be approved by the board 

Section 3 of the act authorizes the prepa- 
ration of street plans for “such territory or 
sections of land in the city as the board of 
survey or the local planning board may 
deem necessary,” and in Section 5 is in- 
cluded a provision that 

If any person or corporation shall hereafter 
open for public travel any private way, the 
location, direction, width, grades and plan of 
drainage of which have not previously been 
approved in writing by the board of survey 
in the manner provided in this act, then 
neither the city nor any other public authorit 
shall place any public sewer. drain, water pipe 
or light in, or do any public construction work 
f any kind, or make repairs, on such private 
way: provided, however, that the provisions 
of this act shall not prevent the laying of 
trunk sewer, drain, water or gas main if the 
same be required by engineering necessities 
for the accommodation of other territory. 

This act will no doubt raise in the minds 
of the city councilmen and aldermen in 
Massachusetts a question which was de- 
bated by several of the delegates to the 
National Conference on City Planning last 
month—the question of where the final 
power ought to rest in controlling a cityss 
growth. We find nothing in the new Mas- 
sachusetts law which appears to give the 
elective city officials any veto power over 
the rulings of the boards of survey. Con- 
flicts of opinion as to the location or width 
of streets are bound to occur, and THE 
AMERICAN City believes that in such cases 
the final decision should rest with the of- 
ficials whom the people elect rather than 
with an appointive board. Indeed, we do 
not expect to see many boards of survey 
appointed in Massachusetts cities until this 
otherwise excellent act is so amended as to 
place the ultimate authority where it be- 
longs. 

Recent experience in Ohio and New Jer- 
sey is illuminating in this connection. As 
our readers are aware, the 1915 legislatures 
of both these states passed new laws au- 
thorizing the appointment of city planning 
commissions. The Ohio act was drafted in 
Cincinnati, while the New Jersey act, which 
covers the smaller municipalities, was pre- 
pared by a committee of the State Cham- 
ber of Commerce on the recommendation of 
a civic organization in the borough of 
Madison. Curiously enough, in neither Cin- 





JuLy, 1916 THE 
cinnati nor Madison have the advocates of 
these laws been able as yet to induce their 
respective city councils to appoint planning 
The stumbling block in both 
cases appears to be the disinclination of 
the councils to delegate even a part of their 
powers to an appointive board. In both 
municipalities the final authority would still 
rest with the councils, for the New Jersey 
act gives the council a veto power by a 
two-thirds vote, and the Ohio law stipulates 
that the recommendations of the city plan- 
ning commission may be disapproved by a 
two-thirds vote of the council if such dis- 
approval is concurred in by the head of the 
department having control of the construc- 
tion of the proposed improvement or utility. 

If our municipalities are to continue to 
ask in increasing degree for the service of 
their citizens on city planning boards and 
commissions, it seems not unreasonable that 
to overrule the actions of such bodies at 
least a two-thirds vote of the city council 
shall be required. THe AMERICAN City is 
convinced, however, that control by major- 
itv vote is to be preferred from tle point 
of view of practical politics and of funda- 
mental democracy. Given such control, the 
appointment of city planning commissions 
will then proceed more rapidly, and the ad- 
vocates of well-planned cities cannot be 
held responsible for upsetting, even par- 
tially, the concentration of power and re- 
sponsibility which charter experts believe 
should rest in every city council.

increasing attention to comparative costs

being paid to the lack of standards for 
making such costs comparable. 

The American Society of Municipal Im-

State of New York. The paper is pub-

is conducting an effective propaganda for 
their adoption by municipalities and engi- 
neering societies. During May the two 
cards reproduced in Mr. Folwell’s article 
were sent by the committee to more than 
2,000 city and town engineers, with a letter 
urging their adoption. 

Substantial progress is already reported 
by the committee. Among the associations 
of manufacturers of paving materials, the 
Granite Paving Block Manufacturers’ As- 
sociation has adopted the units, and will 


urge their use by all cities and others 
with whom they may have dealings. The 
Secretary of the National Paving Brick 


Manufacturers Association writes that he 
is in full accord with this effort of the so- 
ciety, and will do all he can to encourage 
the employment of the units as set forth. 
Among other replies which the committee 
has received, some city engineers state that 
the units will be used in future work, while 
others report that they have been using 
practically the same units and realize the 
importance of changing to exact conform- 
ity with them. At the Syracuse Conference 
the New York State Mayors appointed a 
committee to consider recommending the 
units for adoption by all cities of the state. 

The A. S. M. I. committee realizes that 
objections may be found to certain features 
of the proposed units. They were a com- 
promise among members of the committee 
and the society, but they represent the most 
hopeful attempt yet made to overcome the 
great confusion now existing in computing 
paving and sewerage costs. THe AMERI- 
can City, therefore, joins with the Ameri- 
can Society of Municipal Improvements in 
urging the general adoption and use of 
these units. The result will be an oppor- 
tunity for each municipality to compare its 
costs with those of other cities and towns, 
and to get some real meaning out of such 
comparison,

kel, one of Harrisburg’s public-spirited citi- 
zens, who is interested in the playgrounds, 
was the host to the 3,000 youngsters who 
enjoyed the Romper Day festivities of 1915. 
\ real picnic lunch was spread, and plenty 
of it, with all the lemonade they could 
drink. Mr. Kunkel’s own remark in refer- 
ence to Romper Day is, “It is the happiest 
day in all the year to me.” His generosity 
is appreciated by every boy and girl, and 
that lunch consumed !—well, you 
never saw anything disappear so quickly. 
he afternoon program was worked out 


to see 


in the form of a little play entitled “The 
Princess of Playburg.” The role of Prin- 


cess was played by one of the favorite in- 
structors, who was attended by fourteen 
girls dressed in court style. After the Prin- 
cess advanced to the seat of honor, accom- 
panied by her attendants, the royal pavilion, 
which was especially designed and con- 
structed for this occasion, was guarded by 
a troop of Boy Scouts. 

\fter the salute of the playgrounds and 
the Romper Day proclamation, the Princess 
made a short speech, in which she wel- 


comed the representatives of the play- 
grounds and bade them all be merry. She 
then instructed the herald to sound the 


trumpet—the signal to proceed with the 
program, which consisted of ring games, 
Maypole dances, folk dancing, etc. One of 
the most beautiful spots in the park was 
selected for the afternoon sports, and a 
natural stage setting of green, velvety 
grass provided the best possible floor. A 
large space was roped off for the games, 
and bleachers were erected for the guests. 

The ring games, in which many hundreds 
of children took part, from the very small- 
est to the largest of the girls, was an im- 
pressive picture. The circles, decked in 
myriads of colors, moving in opposite di- 
rections, dancing to the tune of a stringed 
orchestra, was one of the most commend- 


able features of the program. Of no less

they bade farewell to the happy playmates 
and instructors, and with hopes of meeting 
again next year, the playground season of 
1915 ended. 

The success of Romper Day owes much 
to the hearty codperation of the instructors 
with the playground supervisor, and to the 


spirit with which many of Harrisburg’s 
citizens and the parents of the children 
join in making this day a pleasant and 
eventful one. Much work is involved in 


making all the preparations for this cel

with every playground in performing its 
share of the work. 


But it is worth while, don’t you think?

News and Ideas for Commercial and 
Civic Organizations 








O commercial and civic organizations 
a which will be making preparations 
during the present summer for cele- 
brations and other festivities to be held in 


the fall, the first two of the following items 
may offer suggestions of value: 


A Hallowe’en Pageant 

Danvit_e, Itt.—The Danville Chamber 
of Commerce provided wholesome fun for 
its citizens and the inhabitants of the sur- 
rounding country last fall on Hallowe'en 
in the form of a masquerade parade. More 
than 7,000 persons marched in the parade 
and it consumed two hours and a half in 
passing. The line of march was in charge 
of fifteen captains, and they had 150 mar- 
shals under them. The event was widely 
advertised through the newspapers in and 
out of town and by large placards that were 
posted in conspicuous places in nearby 
cities and towns. It is estimated that fully 
40,000 people assembled in the streets to 
enjoy the occasion. Hotels, restaurants 
and other places of business were many 
times compelled to close their doors because 
of their inability to serve the big crowds. 

Prizes were offered to the out-of-town 
group whose costumes were the most orig- 
inal, to-the largest out-of-town group par- 
ticipating, to the best costumed local group, 
and to local individuals whose costumes 
were the best. Masked contestants for 
prizes came as far as fifty miles. In the 
middle of the public square, through which 
all contestants marched, a large stand for 
the judges was erected. The awarding of 
the prizes lasted until after midnight. 

Motion pictures of different features in the 
parade were taken by the Western Motion 
Picture Company of Danville, which in- 
stalled special 90,000-candle-power lights 
with which to make the pictures. Local 
theaters ran the film for a time, and a print 
was also disposed of to one of the large 
weekly news service film companies. 

The parade was managed by the Danville 








Chamber of Commerce, which appointed an 
executive committee of five persons to take 
charge of it. Sub-committees made up of 
nearly 150 men were used in carrying out 
the program. The cost to the business men 
for the evening’s frolic was approximately 
$1,500. Of this amount, $500 was given 
away in prizes. The remainder was ex- 
pended for bands (of which there were 
seven), confetti, decorations, grand stands, 
etc.

Secretary, Danville Chamber of Commerce.

Another Hallowe’en Masquerade 

Huntincton, Inp.—Because the depre- 
dations of the young people in Huntington, 
under the guise of Hallowe'en pranks, had 
for several years been growing worse and 
were more and more difficult for the police 
to control, it was suggested last fall that a 
municipal Hallowe’en masquerade be held 
in which all might participate and the fun 
be legitimized. A masquerade parade was 
accordingly organized by the Huntington 
Commercial Association. The officers of 
the Association handled it entirely, hired a 
band and had the members masked. More 
than a thousand people participated. The 
down-town streets were roped off and no 
automobiles or vehicles allowed on them. 
The sidewalks around the Court House 
were used for dancing, the band playing 
appropriate music. No prizes were offered. 

The crowd was estimated at 10,000, and 
hundreds of automobiles were driven in 
from the surrounding country. The police 
had no trouble in handling the crowd and 
there was no rowdyism. The Police De- 
partment requested the saloons not to sell 
liquor to any person masked. This injunc- 
tion was strictly carried out, and the even- 
ing was enjoyed alike by the young and old. 

The entire expense of the evening was 
less than $30, which was collected from 


willing contributors in fifty-cent pieces.

Secretary, Huntington Commercial Association.

Jury, 1916 THE 
City Ownership of River Banks 

CoLtumsus, Oun1o.—The Columbus Cham- 
ber of Commerce is advocating the policy 
of having the city of Columbus retain or 
acquire the ownership of all river banks 
within its domain for future boulevards, 
channel widening or other improvements. 
In order that contemplated river improve- 
ments may not be interrupted, the Cham- 
ber has decided to prevent as far as pos- 
sible all commercial improvements on land 
suitable or available for public use lying 
along such river banks for a distance of 200 
feet back from the low water mark, and to 
cause the land to be reduced to public con- 
trol as rapidly as may be. 

With that end in view, the Chamber, in 
cooperation with the City Council, was suc- 
cessful recently in persuading the Colum- 
bus Railway, Power & Light Company to 
abandon the site along the river on which 
it proposed to erect a new power house. 
lhe company has indicated its willingness 
to transfer the property, upon which 
now located an abandoned power house, to 
the city at a fair figure to be determined 
by appraisal or otherwise—this at a sac- 


is 


rifice of a central location and consequent 


conveniences. Such a course obviates the

A Motor Bus Service 
FuLtton, N. Y.—When the new state 
road was opened last year between [Fulto 
and the village of Hannibal, the Chamber 
of Commerce saw an opportunit f bring 
ing these two localities into closer business 
and social relations. Fulton, with a popu 


lation of 11,138, was seeking trade from 
its neighboring communities, while Han

of the Fulton 
once proceeded to bring about the organiza- 


tion 


merce at 


of a motor vehicle service between 


these two towns, the busses to run at regu- 
lar intervals. 
The matter of establishing such a servic 


was placed before two local taxicab men, 
but the price at first named for a single 
fare for the eight miles—so cents—was 
prohibitive. \n agreement was finally 
reached under which they were to charg: 


25 cents each way, providing th«

chants would contribute $100 a month for 
the service during an experimental period 
of two months, November and December. 
In a very few days the Chamber secured 
from these merchants pledges aggregating 
$118 a month for the two months. In addi- 
tion, the merchants agreed to give a five- 
cent ticket, redeemable on the bus, for 
every dollar's worth of cash purchases 
made by persons living in the territory of 
the line. The merchants also agreed to 
purchase non-transferable monthly mileage 
tickets at two cents a mile for as many 
miles as they placed opposite their names. 

lo aveid forming a partnership between 
the taxicab men and the merchants, with 
the resulting liability to the merchants in 
case of accident, a contract was drawn up 
and executed whereby the taxicab men 
agreed to establish and maintain the ser- 
vice. The proprietors of the taxicabs ap- 
plied for and received the consent of the 
Common Council of Fulton and the Public 
Service Commission of the state to run the 
bus line. The service was started on No- 
vember 3. 

The success of the line was almost in- 
stantaneous. The residents of Hannibal 
and the intermediate hamlets, Granby Cen- 
ter, Fairdale and Dexterville, were only too 
glad to have an opportunity of banking and 
shopping in Fulton. Again the business 
men of Fulton have demonstrated that in 
order to secure increased business, wide- 
awake methods must be employed. The 
Chamber of Commerce is contemplating 
opening two more bus lines out of Fulton, 


one to Lysander and the other to Mexico.

A “Pigs and Prosperity” 
Campaign 

Avucusta, Ga.—The Agricultural Depart- 
ment of the Merchants’ and Manufacturers’ 
\ssociation of Augusta, realizing that in 
order to stimulate interest in the packing 
plant proposition being worked out by the 
\ssociation, it would first be necessary to 
increase the number of pigs in this section, 
laid its plans accordingly. The suggestion 
was made that the Association give twenty- 
five pigs to that many boys in Augusta's 
trade territory, the boys to pay for them 
by giving to the Association two pigs of 
the first litter; these latter, in turn, to be 
given to other boys on the same conditions, 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


Vor. XV, No. 1 


and the procedure to be followed year after 
year as long as desired. The suggestion 
was adopted. 

The Agricultural Department called into 
conference the county demonstration agents, 
who stated that they would have the 
twenty-five boys on hand at a given date, 
and they kept their word. The Association 
had the twenty-five pigs on hand, suitably 
boxed and numbered. The boys were given 
numbers corresponding to those on the 
boxes and drew for the pigs. Upon re- 
ceiving them, each boy signed a contract 
agreeing to turn over to the Association 
two pigs of the first litter, and agreeing 
to other conditions prescribed by the Mer- 
chants’ and Manufacturers’ Association in 
regard to the care of the pig entrusted to 
him. The boys were accompanied by their 
parents, who promised to assist their sons 
in the care of the stock. 

The pigs purchased were full-bred Berk- 
shires and cost $250. Of this amount $100 
was paid by the Merchants’ and Manufac- 
turers’ Association and the remainder was 
secured from the County Commissioners, 
who were particularly pleased with the plan 
to raise a pure breed of hog in that district, 
and unhesitatingly assumed a share of the 
initial expense. °

A Combination Opera House 

and City Hall 

Duruam, N. C.—The city of Durham 
owns the Opera House and City Building 
shown in the accompanying illustration. 
The building contains the municipal offices 
which are ordinarily found in a city hall, 
also an auditorium which seats 1,547 per- 
sons, including eight boxes accommodating 
six persons each. The building was erected 
in 1909 to replace the structure which had 
housed the city market and a large public 
hall. When the present building was 
erected, a separate structure was provided 
for the city market. 

The city does not directly rent the theater 
part of the building for entertainments, but 
leases control under a five-year lease to the 
highest bidder. The present lessees pay 
$1,600 a year. The terms of the lease pro- 
vide that if the building becomes “unten- 
able on account of fire, wind or any other 
unforeseen cause,” the lease will cease to

Jury, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 


Talking Preparedness and Peace 
Across the Continent 


The transcontinental telephone demon- 
strations given in May by the Haverhill 
( Mass.) Board of Trade and by the River- 
side (Cal.) Chamber of Commerce carried 
messages across the United States whose 
burden in the one instance was American- 
ism and preparedness, and in the other 
world peace. 

At Haverhill eleven hundred men assem- 
bled in the state armory to participate in 
the annual banquet of the Haverhill Board 
of Trade. Hooked under the banquet tables 
were eleven hundred telephone receivers 
which were to connect the diners with San 
Francisco later in the evening. The line 
was opened at nine o'clock, and the guests 
received a thrill when in quick succession 
the various points on the way out to San 
Francisco were called up by Vice-President 
Hall, of the Board of Trade, and the oper- 
ators were clearly heard to give the weather 
and temperature at those places. President 
Wentworth then took the line and con- 
versed with the secretary of the San Fran- 
cisco Chamber of Commerce and with 
Mayor Rolf, of San Francisco. 

Arrangements had been made for the 
home of former Justice of the United 
States Supreme Court William H. Moody, 
Haverhill’s most prominent citizen, to be 
connected with the San Francisco office on 
this occasion, in order that he might con- 
verse with Victor H. Metcalf, who suc- 
ceeded Mr. Moody in the Navy Department 
when Mr. Moody was made Attorney Gen- 
eral. Mr. Moody is confined to his bed at 
his home in Haverhill, having been ill for 
several years. The men exchanged greet- 
ings across the continent. 

After the mayors of Haverhill and San 
Francisco had exchanged felicitations and 
other conversations across the country had 
taken place, Mr. Moody’s home was again 
connected with the armory and Mr. Moody 
addressed the diners at the Haverhill ban- 
quet and the listeners in San Francisco on 
preparedness and Americanism. 

An interesting feature of the evening's 
entertainment was the showing of moving 
pictures of the route followed by the wires 
across the continent. The president of the 
Boston & Maine Railroad was present, as 
were also the chief engineer of the New 
England Telephone & Telegraph Company, 





43 


and other officers of the telephone company, 
besides other guests representing well- 
known industries and commercial organi 
zations in New England. the Board of 
Trade further signalized the event by 
changing its name to Haverhill Chamber 
of Commerce 
* * . 

In Riverside a “Get-together Transcon- 
tinental Telephone Dinner” was given by 
the Riverside Chamber of Commerce to 465 
people at the Glenwood Mission Inn. The 
guests were ushered into the beautifully 
decorated dining room at 6.30. Paper caps 
of brilliant hue, horns and circus “rattlers” 
were distributed and helped to make the oc- 
casion a merry one. Songs, cheers and 
amusing antics were kept up throughout 
the serving of the turkey dinner. 





COVER OF THE RIVERSIDE PROGRAM 


The toastmaster was Roy S. Smith, of 
the American City Bureau, of New York. 
He introduced C. F. Mason, Division Com- 
mercial Agent of the Pacific Telephone & 
Telegraph Company, who gave an interest-

work and aspirations, and showed motion 
pictures of the telephone system. 

At eight o'clock the long distance roll- 
call of cities was begun. The first speaker 
from New York was Hamilton Holt, editor 
of The Independent, who outlined the plans 
of the League to Enforce Peace. Hon.

issue of $150,000 to be expended in improv- 
ing the water-supply system of Emporia,

result is due to the work of the 
special water committee of the Emporia 
Commercial Club, appointed to make a 
study of the subject. The committee’s re-

the need of the improvement, not only to 
the citizens of Emporia, but also to the 
young people who come from nearly every 
section of Kansas to attend the State Nor- 
mal School and the College of Emporia, 
that little opposition was shown at the 
election.

River supply was most favorably regarded 
by the committee, who recommended that 
its possibilities for quantity be developed

improve the service; and to determine for 
the first time in the history of Emporia 
what it is costing the city to provide water 
for its users.

A Men’s Community Center 

lowa City, lowa.—The Commercial Club 
of lowa City has provided a central meet- 
ing place for the men of the community? 
which it calls the Men’s Community Center. 
This is located in a corner room in a sec- 
tion of the retail mercantile district most 
convenient for the farmer, and is primarily 
for his service, though it is much used by 
other out-of-town visitors. 

lhe room is a combination reading room, 
lounging or waiting room, check room, com- 
fort station, employment 
farmers’ exchange. A cigar stand and a 
soft-drink counter are maintained, but 
these features are purely incidental and are 
not allowed to dominate the place in any 
way. State, county and city papers are on 
file, as well as the leading farm journals. 
The market reports are posted daily on the 
market board, and still another bulletin 
board is placed at the service of those who 
sire to use it, either for posting sale bills 
or notices of other events, or for notifying 
the public that a position or a man is avail- 
able, or that a farm is for sale or for rent 

A large parcel room is provided, where 
overcoats, baggage or parcels of any kind 
may be checked free of charge. Free tele-

rhe service rendered by the employment 
bureau is free to botli employer and em- 
ploye, and has been of especial value to the 
farmers of the community in need of help. 
Che efforts of the bureau are not confined 
exclusively to supplying farm labor, how- 
ever, and many positions in the city have 
been filled through this agency. 

Meetings of interest to the farmers are 
frequently held at this center, often at- 
tended by several hundred farmers. This 
is particularly true on the occasion of seed 
corn demonstrations. 

The rent for this room is paid from a 
special fund subscribed by business houses 
and individual citizens, the amounts vary- 
ing from 25 cents to $2 per month. The 
salary of the caretaker is paid by the Com- 
mercial Club from its general fund, and the 
revenue from the cigar stand and the soft- 
drink counter more than pays for the light, 
water and other incidental expenses.

Pruning Evergreens 

Many evergreens are spoiled, through a 
mistaken idea of beauty, by having their 
lower branches cut off. A long, naked sten 
is thus formed which is very distasteful to 
intelligent evergreen planters. An excellent 
way to preserve a perfect shape is to ex 
tract the center bud from any that 
projects beyond the proper limit. 

Most of the upright junipers, hemlocks, 
arbor-vites and cedars are benefited by an 
annual pruning in early spring or late sum 
mer, which causes them to improve in ap 
pearance. If the leader or main stem of an 
evergreen is destroyed by accident or other 
wise, a new one may be readily formed by 
tying up a side branch in as nearly upright 
a position as possible.

Two leaders should 
never be allowed to remain; the stronger

In general: don’t be afraid to trim or 
prune evergreens; keep the knife on them 
constantly. Proper trimming will keep 
them to any desired height for years.

Planning for Civic Betterment in Town and 
Country 


Town and Country Inseparably Linked Together in the Problems of Civic Growth— 
The Importance of Town Planning Legislation—The Need of an American 
Letchworth as an Object Lession 


By Thomas Adams 
Town Planning Adviser, Canadian Commission of Conservation 


N the domain of civics we are concerned 
with questions that relate to the con- 
dition of the citizen—whether in town 

or country. Civic problems are not city 
problems—neither can they be termed state 
or national problems—they are nation-wide 
problems affecting the interest and well- 
being of every local group or community of 
citizens. Wherever there is a group of 
citizens there are civic problems—there are 
questions of local government, public health, 
housing, regulation of land development, 
and taxation. In the small towns with 
large rural areas the problems are largely 
local; but in the big cities or metropolitan 
areas like Greater New York the problems 
for the most part cease to be local and be- 
come almost state-wide in their ramifica- 
tions. The growth of satellite cities around 
the big centers, the overlapping of urban 
areas and rural areas, as systems of trans- 
portation develop, make the artificial limi- 
tations of these large centers meaningless 
and almost absurd. You cannot properly 
govern or plan the Borough of Manhattan 
without regard to the needs and problems 
of Greater New York, nor Greater New 
York without regard to the still wider area 
which can only be described as Greater 
Greater New York. 

Small towns, villages and purely rural 
areas get linked up with and become part 
of every growing city. Whether or not 
they become absorbed in the city area for 
purposes of local government, they become 
no less identified with it and its social con- 
ditions. As the cities become larger they 
spread their tentacles into ever-widening 
areas of open land. Simultaneously they 
attract more and more of the best young 
life of the country, partly to make up for

vention of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs 
at New York, May 29, 1916. 


human wastage and deterioration. Central 
districts become more and more crowded 
and congested at the same time. In con- 
sidering problems of civic growth and pro- 
posals for civic betterment, therefore, we 
have to keep both town and country in 
view—as being inseparably linked together. 
The only land that lies outside of the do- 
main of the secial or civic reformer is that 
which is unsettled and likely to remain un- 
settled by human populations, and even that 
may have a use in our schemes of civic 
or social improvement for purposes of some 
arterial highway or national park. 
Wherever we turn—in new countries as 
in old, in rural districts as in urban—we 
see the need for betterment of civic con- 
ditions. The depletion of population in the 
rural districts and increase of city popula- 
tions, which are going on side by side, 
would not be so serious a matter but for 
two things. In the first place, it is not the 
quantity of the rural migration to the city 
that needs most to be deplored; it is its 
quality. In the second place, it is not the 
fact that cities grow that is bad; it is the 
fact that the growth is neither properly di- 
rected nor planned to secure healthy living 
conditions for the dweller in the city. 


Back to the Land 

We hear of schemes to get people back 
to the land—but have we not as a first step 
to make farming and social life in the 
country more attractive so as to keep peo- 
ple from leaving the land? It is much bet- 
ter to get people who are brought up on 
the land to remain on it than to exchange 
the inexperienced townsman for the coun- 
tryman. Bring more land to the former in 
the city and take some of the city attrac- 
tions and advantages to the latter. As the 
basis for all forms of civic betterment, we 








48 THE AMERICAN CITY 


should plan to achieve all we can accom- 
plish in that direction. A constructive pol- 
icy is wanted in the rural districts to secure 
greater stability. 

Good Roads 

It is essential to promote better roads, 
planned in the right place as well as of the 
right materials—and drained of politics as 
well as of water—for facilitating the dis- 
tribution of produce. With government 
advice, and financial aid if necessary, the 
creation of agricultural village colonies 
should be promoted. They should be 
planned so as to link up with the state sys- 
tem of roads and the railways; provided 
with facilities for social intercourse, edu- 
cation and coéperation; and so arranged 
as to encourage the promotion of rural in- 
dustries. 

Decentralization 

Decentralization of the manufacturing 
industries is taking place on the initiative 
of large manufacturers who are moving 
out from crowded centers to semi-rural dis- 
tricts and creating satellite towns around 
New York, Chicago and other cities. It 
will only be going a step further in that 
direction to get industries built up in the 
smaller towns and villages or in new model 
cities, where low taxes, cheap water-power 
and land, healthy housing conditions and 
good roads will make it practicable for 
small local industries to compete with the 
larger manufacturers in the crowded cen- 
ters. 

Some scheme of planning the extensions 
of the existing small towns and villages is 
also urgently needed, not only in the in- 
terest of the health of those who live in 
them now, but also in the interest of these 
new movements towards decentralization 
which we want to encourage. Many of the 
small towns are at present unhealthy, al- 
though less so than the large cities. If 
they have not overcrowding per acre, they 
have overcrowding per room or bad sani- 
tary conditions. 


Planning for Health and Prosperity 

If more small towns would give up their 
ambitions to become cities and devote their 
energies to being really live and healthy 
towns, they would succeed far better in 
securing a high average level of prosper- 
ity for the citizens. I never can under- 
stand why people waste their time in dis- 


VoL. XV, No. 1 


cussing whether it is healthier to live in a 
city or village or in the country. The fac- 
tors that go to create healthy conditions 
can be had in any kind of community. For 
instance, the overcrowding of the city is 
a condition of disease that ought to be 
remedied where it exists or at least pre- 
vented in the future. If we properly plan 
all future growth, we need not have un- 
healthy conditions in any kind of commun- 
ity. Congestion first causes high building 
values, and then it is claimed that high 
building values cause congestion. The two 
are complementary—they both hinder 
rather than help the carrying on of indus- 
try, they tax production and waste na- 
tional resources. We should prevent fu- 
ture congestion of population and bad sani- 
tary conditions by proper planning of all 
new building development. 

So far I have tried to draw attention to 
the broad field to which we have to apply 
our civic betterment—and if I have devoted 
most time to the small town and to the rural 
aspect of the problem, it is only because 
it has been overlooked and therefore | 
wanted to give it special emphasis. 

It is interesting to note how the popula- 
tion of the United States is divided, as a 
means of showing why this emphasis is 
needed. At your last census in 1910 you 
had a population of about 92,000,000, of 
which over 42,500,000 were living in cities 
and towns, and 49,500,000 in rural areas. 
The increase in urban population was 34.8 
per cent, and in rural territory 11.2 per cent 
between I900 and 1910. Within the urban 
areas there were the following groups of 
cities and towns: 


. Number 
Places of 250,000 inhabitants or over.......... 19 
Places of 25,000 to B5O,000. ....ccccccccccccce 210 
oe oO Ee Ul eee 2,173 


There were also 11,784 incorporated 
places having less than 2,500 inhabitants in 
rural territory. 

In the 19 largest cities there is about a 
third of the urban population, leaving the 
other two-thirds, plus over 8,000,000 more 
in rural territory, in the smaller cities and 
towns. 

In most of these smaller towns there are 
probably healthy conditions, but the main 
point is that they have not grown so large 
that it is not possible by preventive meas- 
ures to avoid the evils that have grown 
up in the largest cities. It is deplorable 
that as cities grow in size they become less

Jury, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 


healthy and efficient in spite of greater ex- 
penditure in applying higher sanitary and 
hygienic standards. [a them you will find 
in the Western Hemisphere the same evils 
of congestion and waste, and the same phys- 
ical and moral deterioration that you will 
find in the older countries of Europe— 
where such conditions are more excusable 
because they have been handed down from 
times of ignorance and oppression, But 
whereas in America there are a compara- 
tively few large cities which have devel- 
oped bad housing or industrial conditions, 
there are thousands in which it is still time 
to prevent their being created. 


Is It Too Late? 

Do you say it is too late to plan your city, 
your town or your village? Go back only 
to 1900. Between that year and IgIo there 
were added 16,000,000 people to the United 
States, and since then there have probably 
been added another 10,000,000 at least. If 
in 1900 it was too late to plan the cities 
and towns for 75,000,000, it was time 
enough to plan for the 26,000,000 that rep- 
resent the subsequent growth. But it is 
too late now to plan for these 26,000,000. 
\ll you can do so far as the existing 100,- 
000,000 is concerned is to replan, to re- 
model—to remedy the evils that exist; you 
cannot plan and regulate the growth in ad- 
vance, as you need to do to get effective 
results. But is the 100,000,000 going to 
represent your complete population, or is 
it not likely that in another twenty years 
there will be another 30,000,000 or 40,000,- 
000 added? What are you doing to safe- 
guard that new growth? What provision 
are you making to plan your cities and 
towns so as to prevent the new growth of 
the next twenty years from causing still 
greater evils than those you will now find 
in the worst sections of New York and 
Chicago to-day? Nineteen city plans 
needed for large cities to beautify them 
with boulevards and civic centers—is that 
your problem—is that your ideal? Or is 
it that three thousand cities and towns 
need plans to secure healthy living condi- 
tions for the greater population of this 
country that lives outside the big cities? 

You have heard of a war in Europe. 
What is one of its most important lessons? 
That the value of the human factor in war- 
fare, as in industry, has been proved as 


49 


never before. And another is—to put it 
mildly, and in commonplace terms—that 
prevention is cheaper and better than cure 
Go into a factory. What is it that counts 


in the worker? Skill and_ industry 
—yes. But these are not enough in these 
days of machinery. The worker needs, 


above all, physical endurance, nerve power 
and initiative—the very things we are de- 
stroying for want of planning our cities, for 
want of looking adequately after the health 
of the citizens, of providing ample recrea- 
tion places for the children and the many 
other things that might be done so much 
better. 

You heard of a revolt in Dublin recently. 
The Christian Science Monitor, of Boston, 
had a report with regard to its causes. The 
writer quotes a high authority whom he 
consulted and who said that all those who 
were responsible directly or indirectly for 
the condition of Dublin’s poor were re- 
sponsible for the outbreak. Slums never 
pay, and the day of reckoning must come 
even if postponed. Slum conditions creat: 
a slum race, which becomes a menace to the 
public weal. To reform them you have to 
regenerate the slummer as well as remove 
the slum. 


Education 

But what are the things you can do to 
rectify these things—to make your cities 
and towns healthier and more beautiful, 
to avoid creating slums? Whatever you 
do, you must educate the people as you pro- 
ceed. In the measure in which you im- 
prove the physique and intelligence of your 
people, you improve the quality of your na- 
tional and civic government. But you can- 
not properly educate a badly housed popu- 
lation. You must rouse the people to dis- 
content with bad environment and to seek 
the truth for themselves. You must get 
your municipal statistics regarding finance 
presented so that every citizen can know 
what his city costs him for management. 
It should be possible for him or her to un- 
derstand whether or why it is the case that 
municipal government costs 40 per cent 
more per capita in America than in Brit- 
ain, as stated by an American authority, 
and why the cost of fire insurance and pre- 
vention is three or four times as much as it 
need be. 

Education is also needed as to the relative 
advantages of preventing bad and crowded

building development of land and having 
to reconstruct or alter that development 
after it has been carried out. In an Eng- 
lish city it costs $8,000,000 per mile to widen 
a street in a built-up area, and in the same 
city it costs about $4 per acre to make ar- 
rangements for the same width of street 
prior to building. In another city the en- 
gineer proved to his council that by plan- 
ning a road into the country in advance he 
could make it 120 feet wide at less cost than 
if he was restricted to 84 feet in width, 
allowing for the cost of land in both cases. 


Housing 

If the planning of cities is to be a success 
it must make the betterment of housing 
conditions its first aim. There is a kind of 
city planning that causes bad housing con- 
ditions by lowering the cost of land devel- 
opment, a cost which at present is greatly 
in excess of what it need be because no 
skilled intelligence is used in laying out the 
land used for building purposes. Hitherto 
it has been allowed to be filled up in any 
haphazard way that suits each individual 
operator in real estate, to be speculated in 
and boosted in value to the detriment of 
the user and without real gain to anybody. 
The first necessity of good housing is to 
control all land development by town plan- 
ning schemes. 


Example of Canada 


I have hinted at the desirability of your 
having a constructive rural policy to deal 
with small towns and rural areas, to in- 
clude a plan of the main arterial roads of 
each state and a plan of each town or vil- 
lage to link up with it. Such a scheme is 
being carried out in Nova Scotia, where 
town planning is compulsory for the whole 
province—urban and rural parts alike. 

The aim is to secure that in the rural 
parts the beginnings of bad development 
will be automatically prevented. Effective 
control can only be secured at the begin- 
ning of development before vested interests 
are created in bad conditions. The worst 
sanitary conditions begin in the rural ter- 
ritory just over the boundaries of the 
cities. In Nova Scotia no buildings will be 
erected nearer to each other than a dis- 
tance regarded as desirable for all future 
purposes of traffic; the local authority is 


Vor. XV, No. 1 


required to insist on sanitary requirements 
in regard to all new buildings; waste of 
money and land in unnecessarily wide 
streets for purely residential purposes will 
be saved; not more than a certain percent- 
age of each lot of land will be built upon; a 
minimum amount of space is required 
around each building to secure adequate 
light and air; areas will be defined for resi- 
dential and other areas for factory pur- 
poses; the character, height and use of 
buildings may be restricted, and not more 
than a certain number of dwelling houses 
can be erected on each acre. 

Thus, while the cities and towns of the 
province are absorbed in remedying the 
evils of the past, they know that just over 
their boundaries care and vigilance are be- 
ing exercised to prevent the recurrence of 
these evils in future. The rural municipali- 
ties can do so because the act is so framed 
that they can secure nearly all they want 
by coéperation with the owners, without 
greater cost to them than that of prepar- 
ing the scheme. Owners of real estate 
will agree to almost all that is required to 
insure healthy growth if they are tactfully 
approached before they start to subdivide 
their land. 

At the same time, the large cities antl 
towns are preparing elaborate schemes for 
their own areas dealing with similar mat- 
ters to the above—all directed to securing 
convenience for all public purposes, proper 
sanitary arrangements, adequate air space 
and recreation facilities and agreeable sur- 
roundings. Beauty in open spaces is sought 
to be obtained by preserving natural fea- 
tures rather than by costly schemes to cre- 
ate new features. Structural beauty in 
public buildings is also sought; but as town 
planning schemes are prepared it is found 
that simple beauty and appropriateness of 
character are values more than ostentatious 
decoration, which is often vulgar and nearly 
always out of place. 

The healthy home and workshop are re- 
garded as the foundation of the newer 
school of town planning in the Canadian 
provinces—the civic center and the public 
building being the coping stone. It is 
hoped to educate the people to appreciate 
beauty in their public structures as a resull 
of enjoying more refining influences in their 
home surroundings. When their civic con- 
sciousness develops to want a beautiful

city they will be the more ready to pay for 
it, and its value to them will be greater. 
In any case a city must be clean and healthy 
as a condition of being really beautiful. 
Therefore, the first object of town plan- 
ning should be to make it healthy and clean 
and to control unhealthy speculation in land. 
That is sound economically and is not un- 
sound from the point of view of art and 
beauty. 

There should be town planning legisla- 
tion in every state similar to that in Nova 
Scotia. 


The Need for an Object Lesson 


Sut America needs one thing almost 
more than any other, and that is an object 
lesson in city building. Why should not 
the women of the United States provide 
that object lesson and build a model city in 
which everything is provided for the con- 
venience and health of the citizens and 
where refined and simple beauty in the pub- 
lic buildings will go side by side with refined 
and simple beauty in the home? Until the 
people of England had built their garden 
city at Letchworth, little progress was made 
in that country with town planning or with 
constructive housing reform. That scheme 
has cost a comparatively small sum of 
money to carry out; it is already paying 
its way and bids fair to be a complete finan- 
cial success as well as a great object lesson 
in social reform. The legislators as well as 
the people of the United States need educa- 
tion as to how to plan for civic betterment. 
The women of the United States can pro- 
vide that education in the most effective 
way. 

Legislation is necessary to make town 
planning and housing reform effective. 
Your police power will enable you to get 
nearly as much by way of preventive 
measures as can be obtained under the 
somewhat more elastic law of Canada. But 
legislation of a constructive kind hardly 
ever proceeds from the politicians. Buckle 
says that “all speculations must be erro- 
neous which ascribe the progress of Europe 
to the wisdom of its rulers,” and that is 
probably true of this continent also. The 
people must lead and educate the politicians, 
and the most essential thing in the process 
of education is to set up an object lesson to 
prove the wisdom and economic soundness 
of town planning, regulation of land devel- 
opment and good housing conditions. The 


Letchworth enterprise started in 1903 on a 
rural estate of 3,800 acres, on which there 
is now a town of 12,000 people It is a city 
of factories, workers’ homes, and yet not 
without its residential area for the well 
to-do. There is no crowding, no tenements 
and no speculation in real estate. The land 
was bought for $200 per acre and is leased 
to the citizens under an arrangement which 
will secure to them that all profits made 
after 5 per cent is paid to the shareholders, 
shall be used for the benefit of the commu- 
nity. Two-thirds of the estate is perma- 
nently reserved for agriculture, to insure 
that there will always be a belt of open land 
round the town. Its death rate is & per 
1,000, aS against 22 per 1,000 in some of 
our Canadian cities. To plan and build a 
combined industrial and residential city 
de novo is a fascinating thing; and to make 
it an economic success is to save a genera- 
tion of talk about theory. 

America has its fine residential suburbs 
for the well-to-do. It has learned by means 
of these that it is a good thing to place re- 
strictions on the use of land. But these 
projects do not solve any problem—nor 
show how any problem can be solved. They 
do not touch 80 per cent of the population. 
They prove the advantage of planning, but 
they help to segregate the rich from the 
poor, with the consequent evils of that seg- 
regation. It is a strange phenomenon to 
find the democratic peoples of the western 
hemisphere—professed believers in liberty, 
equality and _ fraternity—dividing their 
cities into interned camps called residential 
suburbs and downtown districts, with 
barbed wire entanglements called restric- 
tions cutting off one class from another. 
Some day we will see the mistake of that 
self-seeking policy and learn that each class 
needs the other—and the rich need contact 
with the poor for their own sake even more 
than the poor need contact with the rich. 

You do not want to lessen your regard for 
liberty and equality, but you do want to be 
sure that both principles rest on a foun 
dation of justice and human sympathy. For 
liberty may be used by one man to deny 
another man of his liberty, and equality 
has shadow as well as substance. We need 
not be less practical because we recognize 
that righteousness alone exalteth a nation, 
and that the only civic betterment worth 
striving for is that which produces a nobler 
and more virtuous type of citizen.

Foundations for Roads and Pavements* 
By Major W. W. Crosby 


Consulting Engineer, Baltimore, Md. 


HE foundation of a road crust or 

T pavement bears the same relation to 

the whole structure as does the key- 

stone of an arch or the “filling” of a pie. 

Without a keystone a stone arch cannot 

exist, and without proper filling the pie is 
not worthy of the name. 

Let us, in approaching the subject, first 
divide the foundation into two classes—the 
natural and the artificial. The natural 
foundation must ultimately be that portion 
of the earth’s crust on which the beginning 
of the artificial structure rests. It may be 
some distance below the surface of the road- 
way and be separated from the surfacing of 
the latter by various layers of construction, 
including an artificial foundation. 

Summing up in regard to natural foun- 
dations for roadways, it may be said that 
the highway authorities should be sure that 
the supporting power of the material is and 
will be continuously sufficient for the pur- 
pose, and that sufficient protection against 
injury to its supporting power is provided; 
that the foundation should be stable in 
place and sufficient protection against dis- 
placement of it shall be provided; that the 
natural foundation shall be homogeneous 
and uniform in character; and that these 
results shall be obtained at the minimum 
cost. Possibilities of failure in any of 
these respects should generally warrant the 
authority in prescribing reinforcement by 
foreign material or the substitution of other 
material for the natural foundation, or in 
prescribing the use of an artificial foun- 
dation. 


Artificial Foundation 


Under the head of artificial foundations 
will be included for convenience all layers 
of foreign material, not naturally found in 
place, which are specifically provided for 
the purpose of interposing a layer of some 
sort between the natural material and the 
pavement surfacing. Consequently, under 
this head will come layers of sand, gravel 
or similar material, macadam old or new,

International od Roads Congress. 


paving old or new, as well as, in the more 
common exposition of the term, the con- 
crete slab. 

A layer of sand or grave! as an artificial 
foundation for the pavement is sometimes 
used to good advantage on sub-grades 
whose supporting power is relatively weak, 
under such conditions as may be expected 
to prevail around it, and largely for the 
purpose of distributing through the medium 
of a cheaply installed layer, the stresses 
coming down through this layer from the 
pavement, so that the strains on the founda- 
tion will be within what might be called the 
“elastic limits” of the latter. Sometimes 
the further advantages of such a layer are 
that they assist in providing drainage and in 
increasing the stability of the sub-grade in 
places. For instance, such a layer may be 
valuable in preventing the serious effects 
of frost action otherwise taking place in the 
spring. Again with sub-grades of clayey 
material, such a layer of sand or similar 
fine material will prevent the working of 
the sub-grade material up into the some- 
what porous bottom layer of the macadam 
to the detriment of the latter. Again, 
economy may dictate the use of a layer of 
considerable thickness, say two feet, of sand 
for the foundation of a pavement where 
traffic conditions will be relatively light and 
yet an insufficient sub-grade naturaliy ex- 
ists locally. 

Properly graded gravel with sufficient 
sand in it to reduce the voids to a minimum 
will prove an even stronger artificial foun- 
dation than the sand layer above referred 
to, as there will be less tendency toward 
displacement under traffic. In the same 
way, macadam may be superior to the 
gravel layer, and a thinner foundation of 
macadam may equal or be superior to a 
much thicker layer of the best available 
gravel. Well-compacted macadam is high 
in its supporting powers and in its stability 
in place. The difficulties of using it as an 
artificial foundation are those always found 
with materials containing a large percent- 
age of coarse particles—i. e., it is difficult 
to get its surface so even that the surfacing

shall be sufficiently smooth and at the same 
time have the requisite degree of uniform- 
ity in thickness. Without going too much 
into the question of surfacing, the writer 
wishes to point out the necessity, for the 
sake of evenness in wear, of uniformity in 
thickness for the surfacing layer of a pave- 
ment, whether the latter be sheet asphalt, 
wood block, brick or stone block. It is true 
that the blocks are now generally made 
with a reasonable degree of uniformity in 
this respect, but if the bedding material on 
which they are placed be, as is frequently 
the case, sand, it must be considered as a 
part of the surfacing layer. The necessity 
for this bedding layer to be of reasonable 
uniformity in thickness is now generally 
recognized, and a general demand exists ra- 
tionally for a high degree of smoothness 
and evenness in the surface of the founda- 
tion. This demand will exist and even be- 
come more severe so long as a layer of 
material quite different from either the 
foundation or the surfacing material itself 
shall continue to be placed between the two. 


Old Pavements as Foundations for New 

Many brick pavements have been laid 
using the old macadam surfacing as a foun- 
dation. The failures of most of them have 
been directly connected with the uneven- 
nesses of the sand layer required for the 
purpose of evening up the surface of the 
macadam and furnishing a bed in which to 
set the brick. Where newly laid macadam 
has been used as a foundation for such 
pavements, some of the failures have been 
attributable to insufficient consolidation of 
the macadam prior to the brick laying and 
to subsequent shifting of the sand layer 
between the macadam and the brick— 
which shifting was caused or intensified by 
the passage of the sand into the interstices 
of the insufficiently compacted macadam 
foundation—as well as to the lack of even- 
ness of the macadam surface and lack of 
uniformity in the thickness of the sand 
layer. 

Old pavements have frequently been used 
as foundations for new pavements, and in 
some cases an artificial foundation in the 
shape of a stone pavement has been pro- 
vided for the new pavement. Such founda- 
tions are of considerable antiquity. The 
telford pavement as a base for a macadam 
surfacing is a well-known instance. There 
are many cases in cities of this country 





where the streets were originally paved 
more or less roughly with stone blocks, or 
so-called cobblestones, and these old pave- 
ments used, with or without relaying, as 
foundations for different kinds of pavement 
surfacings. Various degrees of satisfaction 
have resulted. Properly laid, the support- 
ing power and stability of such foundations 
are relatively high, and, in many cases un- 
der the local conditions, their use has been 
economical. On the other hand, in some 
cases, the development of traffic conditions 
has resulted in such severe strains on these 
foundations that they have failed and have 
had to be replaced by the more substantial 
concrete slab. Probably most of the fail- 
ures of these’ pavements as foundations 
have come through the lack of evenness of 
surface obtainable on them, and a conse- 
quent lack of uniformity in the thickness of 
the pavement surfacing. 


The Concrete Slab as a Foundation 

Apparently the highest type of artificial 
foundation is the concrete slab. The power 
of such a foundation to distribute widely 
stresses coming through it is very high—so 
high, in fact, that it will often carry stresses 
like a beam. Little has actually been de- 
termined as to its distributing power and 
as to its abilities in pavement foundations 
to carry indefinitely these beam-like strains. 
There is great need for investigation on 
these points. The cement concrete slab, 
however, has proven its ability to aid weak 
sub-grades to carry satisfactorily continu- 
ous heavy traffic; to aid good sub-grades to 
support the heaviest traffic; and, within 
limits, to insure permanency for these ef- 
fects or results. “Within limits” is used in 
this statement because of the rather re- 
cently developed agreement among at least 
engineers advanced in the study of the 
matter, to the effect that cement concrete 
slabs used as pavement foundations are not 
the rigid masses they were commonly sup- 
posed to be, nor is their elastic limit in any 
case coincident by any means with their 
ultimate strength. On the contrary, they 
have a limited amount of resiliency or elas- 
ticity, and they have, what is perhaps fully 
as important, the ability to become perma- 
nently deformed. That is, the cement con- 
crete under continuously repeated stresses 
flows, and the slab takes a different position 
from that which it formerly occupied. This 
theory explains the deformation of the sur- 








face of some pavements which has occurred 
in numerous cases, and which cannot be ex- 
plained by any shifting of the pavement 
surfacing or of any intermediate sand layer. 
In such cases the surface of the concrete 
foundation is found to be deformed, and 
yet no deterioration of the concrete itself is 
evident. 

loo often the practice has been to con- 
sider no care necessary in the selection or 
preparation of the sub-grade where a con- 
crete slab was to be interposed between it 
and the pavement surface. The contrary 
should be the real practice. Not only 
should the decision as to the use of the con- 
crete slab be based on careful consideration 
of the possibilities with the natural material 
of the sub-grade, or of other materials 
brought in for its improvement, but also 
when the concrete slab shall be decided 
upon for use, careful consideration of the 
possibilities of the natural material for the 
sub-grade, and even of other materials 
brought in for its reinforcement, should be 
had. Thus the utmost use of the concrete 
slab may be developed, as well as economy 
had in its introduction. 

The standard concrete pavement founda- 
tion in America is 6 inches in thickness. A 
greater thickness has been advocated as de- 


54 THE AMERICAN CITY 


VoL. XV, No. 1 


sirable and even necessary under certain 
extreme traffic conditions. It is a fact that 
the pavement on a 6-inch slab seems to have 
given way under such traffic conditions in 
certain cases, but it is equally the fact that 
even in these cases the fracture of the slab 
or the actual failure of the slab itself. as 
such has seldom been found to take place. 
What did occur was the subsidence or de- 
formation of the slab without fracture and 
without destruction, and this deformation 
appears to have been permitted by a failure 
of the supporting foundation. It would 
seem to the writer that a remedy such as 
preparing and providing better sub-grades 
should be considered in these cases along 
with the provision of a thicker slab, and 
that the decision might be for one or the 
other, according to the demands of econ- 
omy in the case. 

On the other hand, the necessity for a 
minimum thickness of 6 inches to the con- 
crete slab in all cases may be questioned; 
and why even 3 inches of good concrete 
would not answer the purpose under many 
local conditions and where proper regard is 
to be shown the preparation of the sub- 
grade and the provision of a permanent and 
fairly substantial natural foundation, is not 
apparent. 





Wood-Block Street Paving in Butte, Mont. 


By L. R. W. Allison 


N effective and interesting street im- 
A provement, comprising treated lug 
wood-blocks of tamarack, a western 
timber, has been made at Butte, Mont., with 
an installation of about 8,060 square yards 
of pavement along Arizona Street. This 
thoroughfare, located in the wholesale dis- 
trict of the city, as shown in the accom- 
panying illustration, is crossed by twenty- 
one railway tracks and sidings, and is sub- 
jected to unusually heavy traffic conditions 
to serve the many warehouses and freight 
stations in the vicinity. The street has a 
grade varying from 4.3 per cent at the 
lower end to 4.81 per cent at the upper. 
The wood-blocks used were 3% inches in 
depth, with two '4-inch compressible lugs 
or projections spaced 5 inches center to 





center on one side, and a single lug in the 
center of one end. These lugs extend the 
full depth of the block and form an integral 
part of its composition. They serve as a 
positive expansion joint and provide against 
buckling of the pavement, mechanically 
spacing the blocks % inch apart in all direc- 
tions. The spaces thus formed also effect 
an excellent footing for horse traffic, tend- 
ing to eliminate slippery conditions and 
consequent difficult travel likely to occur 
with wood-block surfacing on such a grade. 

The blocks were treated with 16 pounds 
of creosote oil per cubic foot prior to in- 
stallation, the oil having a specific gravity 
of from 1.10 to 1.12 under a temperature of 
38 degrees centigrade. Tamarack timber 
grows abundantly in the Pacific Northwest,

How to Improve Slippery Pavements 


LIPPERY pavements constitute a con- 
stant street accidents and 
are a serious hindrance to unimpeded 

delivery and transportation. This problem, 
which is receiving earnest attention from 
many municipalities, has been thoroughly 
investigated by San Francisco through its 
Board of Public Works. 

\t the very outset it was realized that 
the grade or level of any street was an im- 
portant element of the problem. 
reason streets were classified as follows: 
(1) level roads in the business section; (2) 
hillside roads of less than 12 per cent 
grade, in the residential sections; (3) roads 
of steeper grade (over 12 per cent). 

In the level business streets the smooth- 
ness of the surface of the pavement is the 
cause of its slipperiness. On this account

For that

vantages, causes troubl vhen wet lo

the Board has adopted the ex edient of 
having the more important thoroughfares 
sprinkled with sand wheney eather ¢ 

ditions justify such a precaution. Coarse 
river sand, when free from clay and per 
fectly dry, has been found to be the best for 
this use. It is distributed by means of a 
special sand spreader invented by Mr. D. J 
McCoy, Superintendent of Street Repairs 


of San Francisco. 
This sand spreader can be attached to th 


rear axle of a motor truck, and it 1echan 
ism is not intricate. Phe spre ider consists 


of a flat steel disk with curved blades, and 
when rotated it can spre 1 tl

the motor truck is $275. The cost of spray- 
ing 100,000 square yards, including rental 
of the motor truck, the services of a driver, 
and the cost of the sand, is $8 in San Fran- 
cisco. 

On asphalt streets of the second class, 
namely, those of less than 12 per cent grade 
in the hillside residential districts, a special 
new process to make them non-skidding has 
been used with success by Mr. McCoy. He 
has succeeded in making the surface rougher 
and non-skidding by a special way of resur- 
facing them whenever the asphalt had to be 
renewed, A Lutz heater heats the asphalt, 
and while it is hot, rock is spread on it, 
then the asphalt is rolled. This process re- 
sults in a rough surface which offers suf- 
ficient friction to be safe, except that it is 
necessary to find a method of combating 
the tendency of the asphalt to spread over 
the rock when such streets are used by 
traffic. This very 
cheap, for one cubic yard of rock is suf- 
ficient for 30,000 square feet, and the re-

Streets of the third class are too steep 
to respond well to either sprinkling with 
sand or resurfacing. For them the Board 
has prescribed paving with basalt block or 
vitrified brick.

public market is now a well-regulated city

market master and the Mayor the head of 
the undertaking. The market is held on 
Front Street in a convenient place easily 
accessible to all persons, and most of the 
business is transacted on Wednesday and 
Saturday of each week. Producers come 
from as far away as 22 miles, and display 
their wares in wagons or carts along the 
curb. All transactions are made on the 
sidewalk, which is sometimes crowded to 
the limit. The city physician is required to 
inspect all the products offered for sale, and 
the sealer of weights and measures sees 
that scales and weights are correct, but the 
price is a matter of debate between buyer 
and seller. Packages are usually carried 
away by the purchaser, although when they 
are heavy and cumbersome they are some- 

times delivered at the door by the vendor. 
The originality of this market institution 
is apparent to any visitor in this genial 
climate. It cost the city nothing: its loca-

roof, the balmy air and open sky; and its 
ornament, the good will of the people, 

which makes it what it is, a free market.

that time until the date fixed for the call 
of the garbage wagon, all refuse was piled 
close to the cans, with the result that it was

We at once established a daily garbage 
wagon service. This, of course, gave some 
relief, but owing to the fact that the alleys 
are only 16 feet wide, it was impossible for 
much sunlight to reach them, and they were 
always damp and unsanitary. 

By consent of the property owners, one 
alley was paved with concrete, the owners 
paying two-thirds of the cost and the city 
one-third out of the general fund. At the 
time this work was done, 2 feet on one side

poles were used, which take the wires 5 
feet above the buildings. 

Each of the alleys is 240 feet in length, 
and in the center of each we have a 250- 
candle-power nitrogen-filled lamp, and at 
each alley and street intersection a lamp of 
the same power which lines up with the one 
in the center of the alley. This makes it 
possible to stand at the end of any one 
alley at night and see to the extreme end 
of that portion of the city which is covered 
hy these improvements. 

According to our experience, the only 
way in which alleys in the business section 
of a town can be handled in a sanitary man- 
he con- 
struction of this pavement not only im- 


ner is by a permanent pavement 


proves actual conditions, but is an incen- 
tive for all concerned to take pride and 
interest in the appearance of the alley. 

Including drainage connections’ with 
down-spouts and permanent connections 
with water mains, the average cost of thes« 
alleys to us was about $3 per lineal foot, 
divided between the property owners and 
the city as explained above. This work 
could have been done at a relatively smaller 
cost if one-course concrete had been used, 
but, with a view to making the alleys as 
sightly as possible, all of them have a 1'4- 
inch top coat. 

Any town or city will find that by making 
the experiment on just one alley by the 
above plan, there will be no trouble what- 
ever in securing the paving of remaining 
alleys. In no instance have our property 
owners objected to this work; on the other 
hand, they are glad to assume their portion 
of its cost. We have on file the specifica- 
tions and plans for these alleys, which were 
compiled by Water and Light Superinten- 
dent Blakeman, and shall be glad to furnish 
them or any other desired information to 
any interested town or city.

A Municipal Playground Basket- 
Ball Team 


Fresno, CaL.—The accompanying photo- 
graph shows the basket-ball team of the 
Fink-Smith playgrounds in Fresno, with 
their director; a sextette of nationalities 
from left to right, Irish, Armenian, Span- 
ish, German, French and Italian. The mem- 
bers of this team have received their train- 
ing on the public playgrounds of the city 
during the last year-and-a-half. Before 
that time none of these boys had seen a 
public playground; some of them had never 
seen a basket-ball. 

This team is remarkabie in more 
than one: it is remarkable for its ability, to 
begin with; the boys—every one of them— 
play for the pure love of the game, and 
never tire of it. Not only do they practice 
at every opportunity on the grounds, but 
they get together every morning before 
school opens and work out signal plots. 
When they win they enjoy their victory, as 
is natural; when they lose they are not 
grouchy, but pledge themselves to a further 
determination to be returned the winners.

Through its recent election Los Angeles

of the cities of the United States. 

It was second only to New York pre-

gate district, containing 48.67 square miles, 
and of Occidental district, containing 1.04 
square miles, it has a total area of 337.92 
square miles. The area of New York City 
iS 314.75 square miles, which gives it second 
place, and Chicago is third with 198 square 
miles, while Philadelphia fourth 
place with 129 square miles. 

The large area of Los Angeles is due to 
the desire of suburban communities to avail 
themselves of the city water.

A Woman-Suffrage, Commission- 
Manager Charter 


A unique charter has just been adopted 
by the city of East Cleveland, Ohio, to take 
effect January 1, 1918. 

East Cleveland is a residential suburb of 
Cleveland, containing about 20,000 inhabit- 
ants. There is a strong sentiment in the 
community for woman suffrage, as evi- 
denced by the fact that at the recent state 
election when a woman suffrage amend- 
ment to the constitution was defeated by 
the state as a whole, East Cleveland voted 
in favor of it. Apparently the home rule 
provisions for the state constitution are 
sufficiently broad to permit woman suffrage 
for municipal elections. A charter commis- 
sion, chosen about a year ago, prepared a 
commission-government form of charter 
for submission to the voters of East Cleve- 
land, and submitted at the same time a 
separate proposal reading as follows: 

“Every woman, born in the United States, 
or who is the wife or daughter of a citizen of 
the United States, or who is a naturalized 
citizen of the United States, who is over 
twenty-one years of age and possesses the 
necessary qualifications in regard to residence 
provided for men, shall be entitled to vote for 
all municipal elective officers and shall be eli- 
gible to be appointed to, to be elected to, and 
to hold any municipal office. All women hav- 
ing the aforesaid qualifications shall also be 
deemed electors and shall be entitled to vote 
at all municipal elections except as otherwise 
provided by the Constitution of the State of 
Ohio.” 


The new charter was approved at a spe- 
cial election held June 6, 1916, and the 
woman suffrage proposal was incorporated 
in it by a vote of about 2 to 1. Mayor Wil- 
liam FE. Minshall, in writing to Tue AMER- 
1cAN City regarding the election, says: 


“The women of East Cleveland will, no 
doubt, take a great interest in the city elec- 
tions, and in my opinion the result of their 
participation in elections will be favorable to 
the welfare of the city.”

Social Survey by College Students 

\n interesting bit of civic work has lately 
heen taken up by the Sociological Club, of 
Stanford University, California, and thence 
incorporated by the Economics Depart- 
ment in the form of a social survey of the 
near-by city of Palo Alto. It is an excel- 
lent example of how the theoretical training 
of the colleges along social and civic lines 
is being made practical and helpful. 

A questionnaire was drawn up and the 
work of going personally to every citizen 
in Palo Alto and filling out the questions 
was divided among some hundred stu- 
dents. The purpose was merely to get 
data on all conditions of the people, not in 
any degree limited to the poor and needy. 
The purpose was so well known and under- 
stood that codperation, instead of the usual 
opposition, met the canvassers. 

The questions listed covered a wide range 
of subjects and touched all the citizens, 
running from such matters as the size of 
the family to membership in art and music 
clubs, and tended to bring out personal opin- 
ions concerning a number of matters of in- 
terest. Opinions were asked regarding the 
advisability of such organizations as the 
Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls. Statistics 
were obtained regarding the churches and 
Sunday schools attended, and social activi- 
ties indulged in. The use of the public 
library was also considered and an attempt 
was made to find out the sort of reading 
done, and to gauge the efficiency of the 
library system. It was inquired whether 
there was any complaint of unnecessary 
noise. Finally, the membership of lecal or- 
ganizations and participation in matters of 
local interest were inquired into, and what 
charitable organizations, music and art 
clubs, or other clubs, were enjoyed. The 
names were taken of those interested in or 
conversant with social problems. 

It is evident that the filling out of this 
questionnaire must result in a very thor- 
ough knowledge of the conditions bearing 
upon civil life in Palo Alto, and that proper 
action taken upon this knowledge will mean 
a beneficial result for the coming genera- 
tion. The data have been put into the hands 
of the local Board of Health and of the 
Economics Department of Stanford Univer- 
sity. Each body will work upon it in its 
own way, but no matter what the actual 
value of the results, and the use made of

The New Jersey Federal-State-City 
Employment Bureau 

\s a result of a recent conference by 
Commissioner Lewis T. Bryant, of the New 
lersey Department of Labor, Commissioner 
General Caminetti, of the Department of 
Immigration, Commissioner Howe, of the 
Immigration Department at Ellis Island, 
and Thomas J. Burns, who represents the 
government in the federal zone of New 
Jersey, there will shortly be established in 
the Ordway building, Market and Beaver 
Streets, Newark, a bureau to serve as the 
clearing house of an employment bureau 
system distinctly novel in this country. 

The Newark office will be the headquar- 
ters for the officials of the State Depart- 
ment of Labor having charge of the state 
employment bureau authorized by an act of 
1915, but for which no appropriation was 
made until the last session of the Legisla- 
ture. It will also be used as headquarters 
by Mr. Burns, as federal representative. 
The purpose of the office is to serve as a 
clearing house for the state, and a working 
agreement will be perfected between mu- 
nicipal bureaus by which, in the event of 
their inability to supply either sufficient 
workmen or satisfactory positions for ap- 
plicants, the Newark office will be advised 
and will make an effort to adjust the em- 
ployment situation within the state. When 
this cannot be done satisfactorily, the aid 
of the federal government will be invoked. 

This scheme as above outlined has been 
made possible through a plan for a national 
system of employment service now being 
carried out by the federal government. The 
entire country has been divided into em- 
ployment zones which are in direct relation 
to a general clearing house at Washington. 
lhe plan assumes the establishment of mu- 
nicipal employment bureaus, such as that 
now in operation in Newark, but these bu- 
reaus are to be assisted by the federal and 
state authorities. 

In addition to the Newark office, a per- 
manent office will be maintained in the post 
office building in Jersey City, under the 
direct control of the federal government. 
The salary of the official in charge of the 
Jersey City office, besides Mr. Burns’ salary 





and the salary of one assistant in the N 
ark office, will be paid by the federal 
ernment. After July 1 the Newark offic 
will be kept open regularly and will be i 
charge of Joseph Spitz. 
No charge will be made to the et 

or the employe, and under no circumstances 
will an employe be furnished where a strik 
is in progress. Any person desiring infor 
mation or assistance in regard to structural 
regulations in building, conditions of em 
ployment, interior factory requirements, 
workmen's compensation law enforcement, 
engineers’ and firemen’s licenses, in addi 
tion to the employment feature, may obtain 
it from the bureau.

Anti-Litter League 
A determined campaign to keep New 


York City looking clean and neat has been 
launched by a number of active men and 
women. It is called the (nti-Litter 
League” and its object is to prevent the 
careless littering of the streets and parks 
It will endeavor to do this by a great cam 
paign for civic education, and will rely 
to a large extent on the codperation of th 
million school children of the city. Th 
league has already enlisted the aid of al 
most all the important city officials and 
quite a number of the prominent and 
wealthy citizens. Mr. Clarkson Cowl is the 
president of the league. lhe placing 
throughout the city of thousands of ad 
quate trash receptacles, which is one of th 
proposed plans, is to be preceded by a con 
test for prizes for the best three types of 
receptacles designed. Anti-litter-ature and 
anti-litter signs will be posted in conspicu 
ous places. 

The school children, however, are to cor 
stitute the regular fighting force of this 
war against litter, and its organizers will 
refuse all offers of compromise. Each child 
who will volunteer to aid will be given ai 
anti-litter button, and a card on one side of 
which is his membership pledge. On th 
other side is printed an admonition as well 
as a caution, which are to be shown to an 
offender without oral comment by the child. 
The caption, in bold type, “You Have Just 
Violated a City Law,” will secure atten 
tion. If the plans of the league carry, New 
York will be greatly benefited by this cam- 
paign.

a 
Wi 


Experience With a Card Ledger for Meter 
Records and Water Bills” 


By W. E. Haseltine 


Secretary, Ripon (Wis.) Light and Water Company 


N the first day of October, 1906, the 
Ripon Light & Water Company was 
fortunate enough to have its office 

burnt to the ground, carrying with it not 
only all of the gas, electric and water bills, 
made out and ready for distribution, but 
also all of the consumers’ records, meter 
readings, maps and data. 

Needless to say, this was not at the time 
looked upon as an unmixed blessing. In 
fact, it was considered something to be 
more or less put out about, and it was some 
time after the smoke had cleared away be- 
fore it was realized what an opportunity it 
created. The slate was wiped clean—no 
consumers’ ledgers, no bill forms, no meter 
reading records, nothing which must be 
conformed to in starting a new set of books. 
When this was clearly realized the decision 
was: “Now let's get right down to brass 
tacks, forget everything we have ever used 
or seen used, and see if we can’t get out 
something that will simplify our work, and 
give us all the information we want in eas- 
ily get-at-able form.” 

Three methods of keeping consumers’ ac- 
counts seemed open: 

1. Regular bound books 

2. Loose leaf books 

3. Card records 

Consideration of the advantages and dis- 
advantages of these three methods seemed 
to point to the last as having the most to 
commend it, and after nearly ten years’ 
actual use there has been ‘no reason to 
change that opinion. 

The first thing done was to adopt a stand- 
ard color for all cards, bills and forms for 
each departraent: white for water, blue for 
electricity, salmon for gas, and yellow for 
merchandise and repairs. 

Next, the size of cards was experimented 
with. 

lhe consumers’ ledger formerly used was 
about 14 x 18 inches, but it was found, 
after making up several forms, that a large 


* A paper read before the annual convention of the 
American Woeter Works Association, in New York, 
June, 1916, 


amount of matter could be gotten into a 
small space, by cutting down margins, nar- 
rowing up columns, etc., and the experi- 
ments finally ended with a card 5 x 8 inches, 
with ample space for all necessary statis- 
tics on one side, and room for eight years’ 
quarterly collections, or four years’ month- 
ly collections, on the other. This is now 
the standard size for consumers’ ledger 
cards in all departments. 

\ similar set of experiments resulted in 
reducing all other records, meter reading 
cards, meter records, work slips, orders, 
sales slips, merchandise ledger, delinquent 
ledger, etc., to a standard of 3 x 5 inches. 

The previous practice had been to make 
the forms any size that happened to seem 
convenient, but it was found that all could 
be made one standard just as well, by giv- 
ing a little thought to their arrangement, 
and this resulted in having to use only two 
sizes of filing drawers, the interchange- 
ability of which is sometimes convenient. 

Having the cards decided upon, two vault 
omnibuses were built to contain these rec- 
ords, one of which was for the bookkeeper's 
use and one for the manager’s. These are 
now safely tucked away in a fireproof vault 
every night, so that experience of the loss 
of records by fire will not be repeated. 

These omnibuses contain all of the active 
records of the company, and the head book- 
keeper can, without moving from his chair, 
reach every consumer record in all de- 
partments. By distributing the various 
drawers, or portions thereof, he can assign 
the work as desired. 

Now as to the actual records: 

For a consumers’ ledger a uniform card 
is used, whether the consumer be flat-rate 
or metered. Fig. 1-A and Fig. 1-B show 
hoth sides of one of these cards. 

Referring to Fig. 1-A, it will be noted 
that this card is arranged for eight years, 
using quarterly collections. Fig. 1-B, 
the reverse side of the same card, shows 
the location of the premises, the date ser-

and file the card with the metered con-

In the card drawers there are three chief 
divisions: Unpaid, Paid, and Turned Off.

This shows at a glance how often and when 
a consumer has been delinquent. 

All meter readings, whether of water, 
gas or electric meters, ave taken on uniform 
cards shown in Fig. 2. These cards are 
3 x 5 inches. 

With direct reading meters the readings 
are entered on the card by the reader, but 
in all other cases he simply marks the posi- 
tion of the hands, and the readings are car- 
ried out in the office. 

These meter reading cards are normally

into the “Paid” section. Therefore, at the 
end of the month or payment period, the 
“Unpaid” section will contain in compact 
form only those accounts remaining unset- 
tled, and these are disposed of by turning 
off or enforcing collection in the regular 
way. 

No back or unpaid accounts are carried 
upon these cards, all delinquent accounts 
being transferred, at the end of the month 
or payment period into a little 3 x 5 inch 
“Delinquent Ledger,” whether these delin- 
quent accounts are for water, gas or elec- 
tricity. In this way the consumers’ ledgers 
are kept clear, and all delinquent accounts 
are bunched where they can be easily re- 
ferred to and handled.

keeper's file. .At meter reading time the 
meter reader arranges all the cards on his 
route in the order of reading, takes out a 
pack of these, and as he reads the meters, 
places the read cards in his pocket. If he 
cannot read a meter, he places this card on 
the bottom of the pack. At the end of the 
day he turns into the office those which 
have been read, retaining only those still 
unread. 

These cards have the advantage over 
meter books of being much smaller, easier 
to handle and less liable to tear. Further, 
the system is more flexible, as the office 
can be entering up part of a route while 
the meter reader is finishing it. These

The School Nurse a Factor in Public Health 
and Sanitation* 


By W. R. Lynch 


Manager, Department of Welfare and Health, Spray, N. C. 


HE following suggestions come from 
the actual experience of nurses en- 
gaged in school work. Many of them 

have been tried out in at least one indus- 
trial community in the South and have 
proved entirely practical. 


Inspections at the Schools 

\t the begining of the school year the 
nurse may assist the physician in making 
examinations of the children. She can re 
cord the findings carefully and file them for 
future reference, and also see that recom- 
mendations for treatment are followed up. 
In case no physician is employed she may 
herself make general examinations and may 
refer defective children to proper sources 
of treatment, through their parents. Sub- 
sequent examinations will enable her to fol- 
low up the with such additional 
emphasis as she can until the necessary 
treatment has been given the child. Exam- 
inations have proved of but little value 
without the thorough follow-up campaign. 

The nurse may make a daily tour of visi- 
tation to each of the classrooms, and, with 
the codperation of the teacher, may study 
any children suspected of being abnormal 
or defective. This, of would re- 
quire close observation for varying lengths 
of time, depending cn the case. During 
these tours she may discove: children 
suspected of having infectious or conta- 
gious diseases, and she will know what to 
do immediately to protect the others and 
prevent the spread of the disease among 
the other children and the community. 


Her Work as a Counsellor 

Who would be in better position to con- 
sider the sanitary condition of the school 
and the grounds, the cleanliness and venti- 
lation of the classrooms, and to make 
recommendations regarding them? The 
school nurse can arrange for personal in 
terviews with the girls and advise and in- 
struct them in matters of personal hygiene

of the school! Not a dead animal, an in-

fresh-air outings for tired mothers and

which can be promoted during this period 
by the school nurse! What possibilities for 
weaving oneself into the life of the com- 
munity and making one’s effort felt in bet- 
tered conditions, in real service for hu- 
manity ! 





A Campaign for Municipal Cleanliness and 
Health 


T a public meeting held in the Audi- 
torium Theater, Baltimore, on May 

23, a campaign was inaugurated to 

make Baltimore “the cleanest and healthiest 
city in the United States.” The objects and 
methods of the campaign were outlined by 
Mayor James H. Preston, who said in part: 


“If we can impress on the citizens the de- 
sirability of having a healthy city, clean pave- 
ments and clean alleys, garbage taken away at 
the proper time, flies and rats exterminated, 
etc., then we will have what I referred to 
about a year ago in a public speech—‘a city 
more akin to the cleanliness of a German city.’ 

“We have laws and ordinances upon what 
must and must not be done, and as far as pos- 
sible insist upon having them strictly carried 
out. There is a point, however, at which the 
law fails and the codperation of the citizen 
begins. The real purpose of this meeting is 
to urge upon you the necessity for collective 
and individual co6peration—in other words, 
that you try to bring home the fact to the 
people that it should be a pleasure for them 
to aid in keeping their premises clean and 
sanitary and not rely so much upon the health 
officers of the city to compel compliance with 
the laws and ordinances which so vitally affect 
the health and happiness of all. 

“In most of the large cities, a clean city cru- 
sade is inaugurated every spring, at which 
time great quantities of rubbish and trash are 
taken from the premises of the homes and 
business places in their respective communi- 
ties. This is a very good practice in one re- 
spect, but I believe it can be greatly improved 
upon. It is our duty to so educate our people 
that they will at all times keep their premises 
clean and free of filth, rubbish and disease- 
breeding accumulations of all kinds. There 
should be a clean city crusade twelve months 
in a year—not confined to any seasonal ac- 
tivity. 

“T intend to use every agency at my com- 
mand, officially, and call upon all the civic 
agencies and individual help I can muster, to 
make this campaign fruitful of what occurs 
to me as a most essential municipal activity— 
one towards health and cleanliness. If you 


will observe the following rules that have been 

laid down for guidance in this work, our ef 

forts will be fruitful of splendid results: 
(1) An energetic awakening of ral 


gene public it 


terest—such as will assure a definite, practical cx 
operation on the part of every mar woman ar 
child 

(2) The starting of a movement umong house 
holders that will check up all filth-accumulating 


practices on private property 
(3) The creation of a public sentiment which will 
stop the tossing or sweeping of paper, refuse and 
miscellaneous dirt into the public streets and alleys 
(4) The introduction of a sanitary garbage can, 
and the handling of the same so as to suppress 
odors, flies, rats and other offensive vermin 
(5) A wisely conducted campaign among the pupils 
} 


of the elementary and other schools hereby the 


children themselves will be induced to observe rules 
of health and cleanliness, and whereby each wil 
become a factor in causing those “at home” to take 
an interest in this movement for a cleaner and more 


healthful city 

(6) A utilization of the powers and influence of 
the various improvement, civic and similar local as 
sociations If all such associations will convert their 
public spirit into definite, practical neighborhood ax 
tion, they will produce wonders The officers and 
members of each association should take up this mat 
ter aggressively and each try to outrival the others in 
this splendid public work 

(7) A special line of action should be undertaken 
by the women wherein they will, by education, sug 


ig 
gestion, example or otherwise, make an effective im 
press for good upon all householders his particular 


item of activity should be handled by a competent 
committee of women 

(8) Development of plans whereby enterprising men 
and women, who have a spirit of initiative and the 
courage to act, will undertake to organize a “block 
movement’’—that is to say, a movement among those 


living in a particular block Coéperation, thus in 
vited, will result in splendid service among the resi 
dents of such blocks These “hlock movements” will 


find the Committee at the City Hall ready to give 
assistance 

(9) Enlisting the influence of the business met 
whereby they will introduce measures that will mini 
mize unsanitary conditions in and around their busi 
ness places or factories; and whereby they will stop 
their employees from throwing or sweeping refuse 
and dirt into the public highways 

(10) The securing of action among the owners 
of stables, especially the smaller or private stables, 
whereby they will reduce the fly-breeding conditions 
that make such stables a menace 

(11) Specialization in the matter of food-producing 
and the food-selling establishments so as to induce 
them to take practical steps towards preventing their 
wares from being contaminated by flies, dirt or other 
disease-breeding agencies. 

(12) The establishment of the best sanitary pra 
tices in the markets. Ways and means, in this direc 
tion, could be worked out by the market people them 
selves under proper expert advice 

(18) Coéperative action on the part of everybody 
in a renewed mosquito crusade.

The Automobile and the City Plan* 


By Nelson P. Lewis 


Chief Engineer of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of New York City 


1. The effect of the motor vehicle upon 
the city plan of the future, and that means 
upon city planning, will be beneficial in that 
it will aid in bringing about some of the 
most important results that city planners 
are striving to attain, such as: 

(a) The discouragement of further cen- 
tralization, by reason of the fact that dis- 
tances can more readily be overcome, and 
less time will be consumed by men and 
women going to and from their work. 

(b) Land values will be more diffused. 
While they will be increased in the aggre- 
gate, sensational increases in some places 
and stagnation in others will be less likely, 
and real estate will be put on a more stable 
basis. 

(c) A better class of street and road im- 
provements wili be insisted upon, and they 
in turn will stimulate better improvement 
of the abutting property. 

(d) The more general use of the motor 
car will result in a better knowledge on the 
part of the citizen of his city and its envi- 
rons. He will thus acquire a greater in- 
terest in the improvement of both and a 
more widespread interest in city-wide plan- 
ning will be developed. 

2. While the amount of traffic on impor- 
tant thoroughfares will be greatly in- 
creased, the greater speed and flexibility of 
the motor vehicle will permit a much 
greater volume of traffic to be accommo- 





*The author’s summary of his conclusions as em- 
bodied in a paper read before the National Con 
ference on City Planning, at Cleveland, Ohio, June 5, 
1915. The complete paper is published in the June 
number of The City Plan. 


dated with safety in the same street, pro- 
vided: 

(a) That the speed and movement of all 
vehicles are controlled by intelligent police 
regulations, so that the safety of riders and 
pedestrians shall be protected. This means 
regulation of pedestrians as well as vehicu 
lar movement, and the education of both 
in the principle of “Safety First.” 

(b) That the width of commercial vehi 
cles is so regulated that the number of lines 
of traffic which a street can accommodate 
will not be reduced and the capacity of the 
roadway thereby seriously curtailed. This 
might be accomplished by the imposition of 
a tax or license fee which would be uni 
form for all vehicles having an over-all 
width of 7 feet or less, with an additional 
tax, increasing in geometrical ratio for 
each inch of width over 7 feet. 

(c) That the wheel loads are so re- 
stricted that the sustaining power of street 
pavement and foundation is not exceeded. 
The most rational way to do this would be 
to prohibit wheel loads in excess of 700 
pounds per inch-width of tire, and these 
only on rubber tires; the maximum loads 
on steel tires to be less, or, say, 600 pounds 
per inch of width. 

3. The greatest congestion, delay and 
danger will be found where the traffic is 
most mixed. The traffic problem will, there- 
fore, be simplified if heavy manufacturing, 
business and residences are confined so far 
as possible to certain well-defined districts. 
Regulations having this end in view are 
becoming more generally recognized as an

essential part of good city planning. 

4. Horse-drawn trafhe requires relatively 
light grades. Motor cars and trucks can 
overcome much steeper grades, and consid- 
able expense can, therefore, be saved in reg- 
ulating streets, as they can conform more 
closely to the topography. The greater 
speed of the motor vehicle will also justify 
longer detours to avoid excessive grades, 
and little time will be lost thereby. 

5. While street corners and junctions 
should be improved wherever possible, 
manufacturers of motor vehicles should un- 
derstand that they must adapt their vehicles 
to street conditions wherever possible, and 
that they should not be satisfied with pres- 
ent practice and expect the city streets to 
be adapted to such practice. The mobility 
of such vehicles, the short turning radius 
for the heaviest motor trucks, and the in- 
genuity which has been displayed in the 
design of trailers which will follow the 


CAN GiTy gy 
tractor without the cutting of corners, give 
promise that such adaptation to existing 
conditions is possibl Ever ttort should 
be made to conform with the « or ¢ 
ditions before demands ar made for modi 
fications of street details at great public 
expense. 
6. With decreasing cost of light mot 

cars and with the likelihood of cheaper fuel 
the number of such cars will doubtless con 


tinue to increase. The problem of their 


accommodation in public streets will solv 
itself with the improvement of the chat 
acter of road surfaces, althoug 
problem will be presented In pl! viding Tor 
the accommodation of standing cars. This 
will undoubtedly require the widening of 
roadways where possible at the expense of 
the sidewalks and the provision at frequent 
intervals of parking spaces where cars may 


be left and cared for at a moderate charge 





Kindergartens 


Supported by the demands of individual 
citizens, women’s clubs, civic organizations 
and the daily press, the school authorities 
of San Francisco have recently recom- 
mended the establishment of 20 additional 
kindergartens. This means that when the 
estimate they have presented to the proper 
authorities has been formally approved, ap- 
proximately 1,000 more children between 
four and six years old in San Francisco 
will receive the well-rounded training 
which the kindergarten gives, through its 
play-work, songs, games and stories. 

Until recently San Francisco has _ not 
been as advanced as most large cities of the 
United States in providing public educa- 
tion for children under primary school age, 
having but 11 kindergartens publicly sup- 
ported. This was the more surprising be- 
cause it had the most famous of the early 
kindergarten philanthropies; and for many 
years no other city had so many or such 
generously provided beneficences of this 
kind, 

Two factors of universal interest stand 
out in the action of the San Francisco 
board: the passage of a new form of kin- 
dergarten legislation in California three 
years ago, and the thorough canvass of the 
state, during the last two years, to arouse 
parents and educators to the opportuni- 


in California 


ties the new law brings to the people 
California now has one of the best kin- 


dergarten laws in the country. It says that 
whenever parents of 25 children of kinder- 
garten age who live within a mile of an el 


1 
mentary school want a kindergarten, the 
way is open for them to get one simply by 
petitioning the local educational authorities 

It was not, however, until the law had 
been brought to the attention of the peopl 
through systematic effort, that any marked 
advantage was reaped from its favorable 
provisions. A number of agencies contrib 
uted to make the law effective. In I9I4 a 
f the United States 
Bureau of Education, who is also a field 
secretary of the National Kindergarten As 


special collaborator « 


sociation, began cooperating with parents 
and state and local school officials to bring 
about the establishment of more classes 
Through her efforts, and the efforts of cit 

zens within and without the schools, the 
number of girls and boys receiving kinder 
garten instruction throughout California 
has practically doubled since this extensior 
work was begun. Los Angeles, which ma 

be taken as an example, now has 133 kin- 
dergartens, as compared with 74 in IgI2 
Oakland, which had only 3 kindergartens 
before the law passed, has 30 at the present 
time.

Municipal Law and Finance 





Abutters’ Rights in Cleveland 

The validity of the provision in the 
Cleveland city charter to the effect .that 
consent of abutting property owners shall 
not be necessary to the construction of a 
street railway improvement, was recently 
upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in the 
case of Billings vs. Cleveland Railway Com 
pany. The chief question of law involved 
in the case was as to whether the Cleveland 
charter, adopted under the Home Rule 
\mendment to the Ohio Constitution, pre- 
vailed as against the general laws of the 
state, so far as the city of Cleveland is con- 
cerned. The charter specifically made un- 
necessary the securing of property owners’ 
consent to a street railway improvement, 
and the Supreme Court declared that the 
building of a street railroad within a muni- 
cipality was a matter of purely municipal 
concern and that the charter prevailed as 
against the state law.

Controlling Use of Private Property 


\n ordinance of the city of Goodland, 
Kan., provided that it should be unlawful 
to deposit or permit to remain on any lot 
in the city “any tin cans, manure, ashes, 
garbage, slops, swill, refuse, filth, offal, un- 
wholesome substance, vegetable matter, or 
animal matter, or any rubbish whatever.” 
lhe Kansas Supreme Court has just de- 
cided that this ordinance is void for failing 
to discriminate between noxious and _ in- 
noxious substances. The court points out 
that the ordinance did not merely purport 
to prohibit deposits which would be offen- 
sive to neighbors or detrimental to the pub- 
lic health. The measure was held to be bad 
because it would prevent ashes from being 
kept in even a safe receptacle, and garbage 
from being held until called for by a col- 
lector, and because it would virtuaHy pre- 
vent keeping of domestic animals in the 
city, inasmuch as their manure could not 
be immediately removed from the city 
The opinion concludes: “Having under- 


taken without qualification to make things 
nuisances which are not so in fact, and 
which become nuisances only under condi 
tions which are not recognized, section 
of the ordinance is void.” (City of Good 
land Vs. Popejoy, 157 Pac inc Re | ortet

Municipal Responsibility 
Concerning Streets 

Although it may be public-spirited, and 
for that reason commendable, for municipal 
officers to invite residents of their city to 
deposit rubbish in streets for collection by 


the municipality, instead of requiring or at 
least allowing the residents to do that work 
for themselves, the municipality is liable for 
injuries sustained by a traveler along a 
street, resulting from such obstructions, a 


cording to a late decision of the \ppellate 


Division of the New York Supreme Court 


handed down in the case of Lyman vs. Vil 
lage of Potsdam, 159 New York Suppl 
ment, 7I. The court said ‘It is the duty 


of a municipality to keep its streets fre 
from obstructions. ... A nuisance was

Referendum Repeal of Ordinances 


When an ordinance adopted by a city

the Minnesota Supreme Court in the r 
cent case of Megnella vs. Meining, 157 
Northwestern Reporter, 991. But the court 
also decides that “it is equally clear that 
the council is not prevented from legislat 
ing on the subject-matter of the dead ord 
nance. It doubtless may, if it acts in good 
faith and with no intent to evade the effect 
of the referendum petition, pass an ordi

Validity of Municipal Contracts

the municipal officers to make contracts and 
the manner in which contracts must be 
made, in the case of City of Princeton vs 
Princeton Electric Light & Power Com- 
pany (179 Southwestern Reporter, 1,079),

complying with charter requirements for

A Free Legal Aid Bureau for 
Lincoln, Nebraska 

The city of Lincoln, Neb., has an ordi- 
nance, fathered by Mayor Charles W. 
Bryan, which authorized the establishment 
of a free legal aid bureau where persons 
unable to pay lawyer’s fees could obtain 
legal advice. The bureau was opened in 
October, 1915, in charge of Sterling F. 
Mutz. Since that time it has handled 197 
cases and has collected in wages for its 
clients an amount approximating $750. 
* The text of the ordinance (No. 1357) 
estaviishing the bureau is as follows: 


Section 1. There is hereby created a free legal 
aid department of the city of Lincoln, Nebraska 

Section 2. Said department shall be under the 
supervision and direction of the commissioner of 
public affairs, and shall be conducted by the city 
attorney. 

Section 3. The city attorney shall, upon request 
by residents of the city of Lincoln, who are not 
financially able to employ counsel, such _ inability 
having first been shown to the satisfaction of the city 
attorney, furnish such persons legal aid and advice, 
and defend them in any civil litigation in which, in 
his judgment, they “are being persecuted or unjustly 
harassed.

The First Hay-Fever Ordinance 

lo the city of New Orleans is attributed 
the distinction of having enacted the first 
hay-fever ordinance in America. Whil 
hay fever is not a disease that figures in 
the death rate, it is a disease that occasions 
much suffering and annoyance to those af- 
flicted, who are said to number about 2 per 
cent of the population in many sections of 
the United States. 

lhe ordinance was passed by the New 
Orleans Commission Council through the

Topeka’s System of Handling 
Municipal Bonds 


Kansas municipal bonds have proved to 
be an attractive investment for shopmen, 
clerks, professional men, merchants and 
business men generally. This is due partly 
to the fact that municipal bonds in Kansas 
are non-taxable; but it is due even more 
to the plan introduced by W. H. Wasson, 
Commissioner of Finance and Revenue, by 
which the bonds are sold. 

Under the previous system Topeka’s 
bonds were offered in large blocks to East- 
ern buyers. Now the bonds are issued in 
instalments. They bear 4% per cent inter- 
est and are sold at par. The distribution 
of the bonds to the buyers is done through 
cooperation of the city with some bank or 
trust company, which has charge of hand- 
ling them. The city draws two per cent per 
annum on the daily bank balances. By 
issuing the bonds in installments the money 
is secured as needed by the city in carrying 
on its various phases of municipal endeavor. 

The aim is to distribute bonds among 
people in and about Topeka first, care being 
taken to see that the small investors are 
supplied before those who wish to subscribe 
for large amounts. 

Persons who purchase Topeka’s bonds 
naturally taken a keener interest than they 
otherwise would in the city’s affairs. This 
makes them better citizens. Commissioner 
Wasson also points out the fact that by sell- 
ing the city bonds to the home folks the 
money is kept in Topeka. When a coupon 
is paid or a bond is redeemed, a resident 
gets the money, and in the latter case he 
will usually be ready to buy another bond 
with it.

This line has built for itself an unequaled reputation for mechanical perfection, efficiency and low cost of 


operation, and each machine that leaves our factory must be worthy of the “Panama Line.” 


The “Panama” Giant 


his machine is now pronounced, by the best experts of the country, to be the highest type of reversible road 
machine. For range of work, strength, durability and ease of operation it is unexcelled and, although built for 
tractor use, it will stand the strain of continued engine use, and of doing its own plowing. 


The “Panama” Giant with Scarifier 


lhe “Panama Scarifier” which is built into and is really a part of this machine gives two machines in one 
Che attachment may be used with the blade or drawn up out of the way and the blade used alone. There is no 
necessity to remove the one while the other is being used, as is the case in other machines. 


The “Boston” Grader 


“The most successful light grader ever produced.” Owing to its light weight and small size it will work under 
conditions and in places where it would be impossible to work a larger machine satisfactorily. The blade can be 
lowered or raised easily from the driver’s seat and the machine can be shifted 22 inches on the rear axle. It takes 
but a few minutes work to tilt the blade and you have a most efficient drag.

ease of operation for both man and beast. The machine can be worked with or without a tongue and will turn

Spending Money to Save It 


An Editorial from The Chicago Daily Tribune 


HERE always will be complaint that 
the Chicago Plan Commission is 
nothing more than an _ organized 

scheme to increase taxes, and that its chief 
function has been to tempt the city into 
vast expenditure for beautification of the 
lake front and the boulevards. Whenever 
Charles H. Wacker or any of the other 
disinterested citizens tell what the commis- 
sion is doing they give rise to exactly that 
sort of talk. ; 

It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that 
the city plan commission is effecting, and 
will effect in the future, enormous econo- 
mies for the city. These expensive projects 
which the commission advocates so earnest 
ly will save the next generations of Chi 
cagoans from the expense of tearing down 
what we are building up. 

If we had had such a commission twenty 
years ago we should not be spending money 
and energy on complicated terminal prob- 
lems, nor bewailing the absence of streets 
leading out of the loop district. We should 
not have a postoffice which is far too small 
to handle our mail. We should not be tear- 
ing down huge new buildings to make way 
for railroad stations. 

Chicago has not stopped growing. Both 
the city as a corporation and the citizens as 
individuals will spend millions of dollars 
building and rebuilding the city. It is to 
make this expenditure as economical as 
possible that the Chicago Plan Commission 


was organized. Anyone can understand 
that to erect beautiful residences in a se 
tion of the city which in five years will be 
overrun by factories is an enormous waste 
of money. If we build wrong our children 
will have to tear down, even if «ve are not 
compelled to tear down ourselves 

Every department of the city should be 
closely affiliated with the Chicago plan. If 
they do, fewer streets will be too narrow or 
too wide, fewer useless car lines will be 
established, fewer sewers will have to be 
relaid and enlarged. A proper coordination 
of the departments and the public utilities 
companies would prevent half of the tearing 
up of the streets. Chicago tears up hun- 
dreds of miles of streets a year for one pur- 
pose or another. A pavement is hardly 
down before portions f it have to be torn 
up. 

Under a scheme of unregulated growth, 
Chicago would have to rebuild itself every 
few years. There is far too much of that 
now. It is stupid expense that the Chicago 
plan commission is attempting to eliminate 
Most of the money we are spending now is 
being spent to correct past n istakes. 

Of course, no city planning commission 
is infallible We shall continue to spend 
some of our money on projects which we 
shall regret. But the commission is helping 
us get full value for every dollar we spend 
in buile'ng up the city.

Jury, 1916 THE 
National Conference on City Planning 

Boiled down to five brief paragraphs, the 
principal ideas emphasized at the National 
Conference on City Planning, held in Cleve- 
land June 5 to 7, may be summarized as 
follows: 

1. Districting by municipal regulation as 
to height, area and use of buildings is com- 
ing to be generally recognized as a funda- 
mental of city planning. The work being 
done by the Commission on Building Dis- 
tricts and Restrictions in New York City is 
worthy of emulation as to method of proce- 
dure; but other cities will make a serious 
mistake if they copy in their plans the act- 
ual restrictions proposed for New York. 
Such cities still have time to prevent the 
excessive congestion on which the recom- 
mendations of the New York commission 
have of necessity been based. 

2. The automobile has become a factor to 
be reckoned with most seriously in city 
planning. Width of streets, character of 
paving and methods of regulating traffic 
must be planned with increasing attentiov 
to the requirements of motor trucks and 
pleasure vehicles. 

3. Progressive real estate subdividers 
recognize the value of applying city plan- 
ning principles to land development. They 
recognize, too, that their own planning and 
restrictions can be made much more effec- 
tive if codrdinated with well-considered 
plans for the city as a whole. 

4. As the vast majority of cities have 
less than 100,000 population, the Confer- 
ence wisely devoted two sessions to the 
problems of such cities. By planning now 
for future growth, the present generation 
can increase its own welfare and save the 
next generation the cost and discomfort of 
many surgical operations to the city plan. 

5. City planning is only partly effective 
unless correlated with country planning. 
There is much to be said for the desirabil- 
ity of having in each state a central author- 
ity to prepare a state-wide plan and to co- 
ordinate in some degree the town planning 
work of the various municipalities. 

Substantially the same group of men who 
have served the Conference so effectively 
on its general committee and executive 
committee were reélected at the Cleveland 
meeting. Frederick Law Olmsted, of 
Brookline, Mass., was again chosen as 
President; Nelson P. Lewis, of New York, 
Vice-President, and Flavel Shurtleff, of

Committee. 
1917 conven- 


A plea for increasing the usefulness of 
the Association’s work was made by the re- 
tiring president, Nicholas S. Hill, Jr. The 
appropriation of adequate funds for com- 
mittee work, coérdination of the work of 
local associations with the parent body, and 
the separation of the duties of secretary 
and editor were among the important rec- 
ommendations made. 

Many valuable papers were read, several 
of which are published in the June number 
of the Association’s Journal. A demand 
was expressed that next year’s program 
allow more time for the Superintendent’s 
Day discussion, and a resolution was passed 
calling for at least two, and if possible 
three, sessions for this purpose.

Believing that health administration must he 
divorced from politics and recognized as a special 
profession, the author of this book appeals to his 
readers to help in the great work of spreading the 
doctrines of present-day preventive medicine and 
in urging a more extensive public health service 
and increased facilities for training health officers and 
sanitarians. The development of public health work 
in the United States and the existing national health 
agencies are discussed by the author, and he compares 
medical and sanitary education as constituted at 
present. He shows fhat social and economic condi 
tions have changed, these changes being largely due 
to advancement in science, until at present, in school 
medical inspection work and similar activities of 
recent growth, we find the commencement of a new 
era in public health work. The organization of 
health departments and the preparation of health 
officers are discussed in the closing chapters of the 
book.

GALION STREET AND ROAD SIGNS 








THE SIGNS EVERLASTING—EVER READABLE 


Galion Street and Road Signs are the strongest and most durable signs 
on the market. Made of two heavy anti-corrosive galvanized, black enameled 
sheets and one sheet of aluminum. The letters are formed by the sheet of 
aluminum showing through the front sheet, out of which the letters have heen 
cut. The letters cannot work loose or be knocked out of position, will not lose 
their bright appearance and require repainting. 

On account of their unusually strong and durable construction Galion 
Signs will withstand more ordinary wear and tear and greater abuse than any 
other sign. There are many other reasons why you should use Galion Signs 
to mark the way—our new bulletin will give you more of them—write for your 
copy today. 


GALION IDEAL CAST IRON FLAT TOP PIPE 


Built especially for sidewalk crossings 
and street surface drainage. Made from 
pure pig iron, which gives it greater strength 
and lasting qualities than are found in any 
other pipe. 





If you are interested in any kind of Road Machinery or Municipal Equipment it will 
pay you to investigate the Galion line which includes: Road Graders, Road Drags, Scarifiers, 
Cast Iron and Corrugated Culverts, Catch Basin Covers, Bulkheads, Road and Rooter Plows, 
Stone Unloaders, Gravel Screening Plants, Rock Crushers, Rollers and Tractors, etc., etc

A New Kind of Handcuff 


Guardians of the law and all those who have 
occasion to deal with the refractory element 
of the population, will welcome the addition of 
the “Peerless” handcuff to their equipment 
It is a new device, but it is already in use in 
every state of the Union, as well as in the 
United States Government Secret Service Di- 
vision, the Canadian Government and _ in 
others. 

Among the features of the Peerless hand 
cuff, the following are described in a folder 
which can be obtained from the Peerless 
Handcuff Company, Springfield, Mass 


1. It is the only handcuff that positively cannot bx 


come locked in the pocket, and is thus always ready 
for use 

2. It is light in weight—12 ounce and no burder 
to carry 


It is simple, has no projecttng shoulde: 
nothing to tear or rip the pocket 
4. It is self-locking when placed on a perso 
wrist, and can then be locked in a fixed position, if 
desired, by one complete turn of the key 
It is so made that the locking jaw can be ¢

If it is closed by a person resisting arrest, it can be

An Automatic Water Stage Register 


Water-works and sewage disposal officials 
will be particularly interested in the new in- 
vention of an automatic water stage register 
which makes a seven-day graphic record. It 
is patented and manufactured by the W. & L. 
E. Gurley Company, Troy, N. Y. It is of sim- 
ple construction, with few parts, and is de- 
signed for easy operation. Its especial merit 
is the accuracy of its measurement, and it is 
said to be very efficient when thus used by 
city water departments. 

The accompanying illustration shows its 
several unique features. Two standards, 
erected on a base, support the mechanism of 
the register. To the larger of these stand- 
ards is attached an eight-day clock, which is 
geared to the two time screws supported at 
each end. Mounted on the two screws is the 
pencil carriage, which is free to move forward 
without lost motion in accordance with the 
movement of the clock, and can be adjusted 
as needed. The pencil is held in a clamp, 
which moves vertically in a cylinder, and is 
set so that the weight of the clamp presses it

down against the paper, thus in 
suring a distinct recording line. 
The recording cylinder on which 
the paper is placed is supported on 
a shaft between the two standards, 
and is held in position on the shaft 
by a clamp at one end. Many lit 
tle devices to adjust it to varied 
needs are included in its construc- 
tion, 

Che company is also prepared t 
supply a modification of this reg 
ister, which will give a seven-day 
graphic record by natural scale and 
has a range of one foot. This me 
chanism is especially adapted for sewerage

Locating Leaks in Water Pipes 

In many water-works enormous quantities 
of water are lost through leaking service pipes 
Many such leaks discharge into underground 
drain tiles, and though the consumer's supply 
may not be affected, the municipality will be 
expending a great deal of money for water 
that is going to waste. Moreover, such a loss 
may go on undetected for a long period of 
time. 

in order to remedy such a condition, The 
H. W. Clark Company, 130 South Seventeenth 
Street, Mattoon, Ill, has made a number of 


instruments designed to discover and locate 


leaks in small pipes by means of determining 
the loss in pressure I 


occasioned thereby 
The use of the Clark inspector’s gauge ¢ 


be illustrated as follows An imspector finds 
for instance, that at one house the gauge indi 
cates a pressure of 40 pounds. He goes to the 
next-door service and possibly finds that his 


gauge there shows only 35 pounds, evidencing 
a loss of 5 pounds in pressure He knows 
instantly that the a leak in the servic« 
somewhere. By a few hundred call 
he knows what hest essure ind 





how much pressure is lost by leaks

GASOLENE IS MORE DANGEROUS 
THAN DYNAMITE 


Dynamite will only explode from two or three causes, 
easily guarded against, but the vapor from gasolene will 
explode from many causes. 

You can see dynamite and beware of it—but gasolene 
vapor is invisible, and it is in the VAPOR that the 
danger lies. 

Municipalities therefore should see to it that gasolene 
is always stored and handled in accordance with the 
most rigid requirements of the Fire Underwriters. We 
manufacture a complete line of tanks and pumps for this 
purpose, over a million of which are in use in the U. S. 
and Canada with never a fire or explosion. 

Our Bulletins contain much information on this sub- 
ject and we'll gladly send them free on request.

An Asphalt Heater Used for 
Melting Snow 


The accompanying illustrations show the 
novel use of the Kerns-Prescott asphalt road 
heater for melting snow in Glencoe, Ill. The 
heater was used by John A. McGarry & Co., 
of Chicago. It is an 8-ton roller (Iroquois) 
converted to the use described, by the Barber 
\sphalt Paving Company, of Buffalo, N. Y. 
The large flue was built on to carry the flue 
gases over the top and down the 5- x 7-foot 
hood. 

\ 4-inch snowfall covered up the last 5,400 
square yards of a 63,000-square yard penetra 
tion job, and the heater was used to melt the 
snow from the two inches of top stone already 
spread on the concrete base The cost of the 
snow removal was as follows 


Removal of heavy part of snow by hand $17.00 
Rent of heater 4 days at $20 a day.. S000 
Engineer at $6.50 per day, including car far: 6.00 
Helper at $3.50 per day, including car fars 14.00 

Pocahontas coal at $6.25 a ton delivered, at 
fe. fee ait eve . 12.50 
$149.5 


his amounts to nearly 3 cents per yard for 
melting alone. The actual pouring was also 
retarded about 50 per cent, as it had to be 
done close behind the heater and the stone 
screening for the top also’ had to be heated 

[he Kerns-Prescott heater is used exten- 
sively in the resurfacing of worn-out asphalt 
streets. A considerable part of Broad Street, 
Philadelphia, was resurfaced with this ma- 
chine some five years ago and is in excellent 
condition to-day. Another application of the 
heater is in thawing out ground when exca- 
vation in frozen ground is necessary; a con- 
siderable amount of work of this kind has 
been done with the heater, for it is especially 
useful in mid-winter when an emergency 
makes it necessary for a piece of ground to 
be improved or resurfaced immediately:

The Strength of a Brick Pavement 


By Randall Barrett 


County Engineer, Wayne County, Ohio 


Mishaps often teach more about the strength This was probably not t es 
of materials than could be learned in years of _ the rigidity of the brick shelf g 
ordinary use. An accident this spring to one refill the wrecked embar ent, lat boulder 
of the newer brick highways in Wayne County, were hauled, dumped t ment a

repair bill in demonstrat- 





ing the degree of solidity — 
that can be had in a 
grouted brick road _ sur- 
face, when all the details 
of good construction have 
been complied with prop- 
erly 

The paving referred to 
is located a short distance 
west of Wooster, the 
county seat, where the 
road skirts a small stream 
known as Killbuck Creek. 
Following spring storms, 
the water overflowed the 
road for many hours and 
the effect upon the pav- 
ing was meantime the oc- 
casion for considerable 
anxiety. When the water 
receded, it was found that 
the embankment support- 
ing the road had been 
gouged away by the swift 
current for several hun- 
dred feet. For a distance 
of sixty feet the concrete 
base of the pavement had 
been undermined and had 
fallen away, leaving noth- 
ing but the brick surface 
intact, 

It struck me as suf- 
ficiently remarkable that 
the base, a homogeneous 
slab, should fall away, 
while the brick course, 
consisting of a large num- 
ber of units, should be 
left undisturbed. But a 














greater surprise followed TESTING THE RIGIDITY OF THE BRICK PAVEMENT

Cast Iron Pipe for 
Road Culverts 


The culvert pipe of cast 
iron illustrated on this 
page is one of a variety of 
sectional flat- and perfor 
ated-top culverts manufac- 
tured by the Galion Iron 
Works & Manufacturing 
Company, of Galion, Ohio 
Bulletin No. 1, which de 
scribes this culvert, con 
tains also some very inter 
esting data upon the wear 
ing qualities of cast iron 
pipe in general. This pipe 
is supposed to have been 
originally made by the 
Germans about the middle 
of the fourteenth century. 
rhe first authentic case of 
its use is the pipe line 
from the reservoirs of 
Picardie to the reservoirs 
of Montbauron, which was 














put down by order of 
Louis XIV to supplement 
the water supply of the 
city and parks of Versailles. This line, almost 
five miles in length, was laid nearly 250 years 
ago—between 1664 and 1668—and is still in 
service. The pipes which comprise the line 
from the park of the Trappists to the reservoirs 
of Montbauron are 20 inches in diameter: two 
20-inch and three 13'%-inch pipes leading from 
the reservoirs to the gate house, and two 20 
nch pipes and a 13'2-inch pipe leading from 
the reservoirs of Gobert to the reservoirs of 
L’Aile. These aggregate 27,500 feet in length, 


/ 
were laid in 1685, or 231 years ago, and are 
still in use. Two years later, in 1687, the 
duit of Chevreloup, 13% inches in diameter 


and 11,500 feet long, was laid from the reset 
voir of L’Aile to the Trianon. All of these 
pipe lines consist of pipes one meter (37.39 
inches) in length, joined by means of bolted 
flanges. They are of considerable weight and 
still serve their purpose satisfactorily. The 
bulletin contains, in addition to this informa-

A CHAMBER OF 











COMMERCE THAT HAS 
STOOD THE ACID TEST 











Time is the acid test of Chamber of Commerce strength. 


Over three years ago the Olean (N.Y.) Chamber of 
Commerce achieved its present strength under the 
guidance of Mr. Lucius E. Wilson, campaign director 
of the American City Bureau. 


The old organization had had a yearly income of less 
than $1,000. This was increased to over $12,000, 
although the population of Olean is only 15,000. 


then people who had been saying “It can’t be done,” 
changed their tune to “It won’t last.” 


This statement has been answered—IT HAS LASTED. 


The original memberships were based on three year 
pledges. These pledges expired a few weeks ago. 
Practically all of the old members have re-pledged 
themselves without hesitation for another three years. 
New members have been added which more than make 
up for the few losses. 


There are good reasons to explain this support. You 
could find out about them by writing for a pamphlet 
we have just published concerning the Olean organi- 
zation.
