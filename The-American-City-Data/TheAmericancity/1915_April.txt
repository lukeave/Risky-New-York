Boston Giant Park Sprinkler in Operation on Boston Common 


Boston Giant Park Sprinkler 


for watering parks, estates, polo grounds, fairways, putting greens, 
baseball grounds and cemeteries. This sprinkler is mounted on a sub- 
stantial four-wheel truck and fitted for a 24-in. hose connection. Once 
installed it serves for an indefinite period, safeguarding the condition of 
the soil and grass against serious injury during dry period. 


Under 30 pounds pressure it requires only 40 minutes at each set-up 
to wet the soil 6 in. deep. Does not flood or wash the grass roots. 


The Boston Giant Park Sprinkler produces a continuous artificial 
shower, spreading the water uniformly into a fine, dense, rain-like spray 
over a diameter of 80 to 150 feet. 

We also make a park sprinkler specially designed for use on putting 
greens of golf courses and in other places where the soil is light or the 


turf very sensitive. This sprinkler is called our Boston, Jr. Park Sprinkler.

At an unusually small first cost and an unusually 
low cost of operation and upkeep, the Dayton Tri 
Car Chemical will furnish your city with the 
dependable ever-ready protection so important to 
the safety of your property and that of your 
neighbors.

Bi-Lateral Hose in Service 
Twice as Long 


It will not leak —the construction is such that the insid 
rubber cannot crack nor have pin holes. Read why 


The rubber lining of Bi-Lateral is left free from its jacket This 
gives the lining freedom when the hose is flattened so that the tube 
takes two curves (see lower illustration) at the points of fold which 
relieves the compression. The rubber remains the same size whether 





flattened or under pressure We will be glad to send

Yes, Archibald, a meter at $5.00 1s cheaper 


in first cost than a meter at $8.00 to $10.00. 
So is a $5.00 shoddy suit cheaper at first than 
all-wool at $30.00. However, the buyer of 


meters, like the buyer of clothing, needs to look 
a little further than the end of his nose. If you are 
buying a suit of clothes to wear in cleaning out a 
sewer, the $5.00 suit may do about as well as the 
$30.00 one. And if you are purchasing water meters by 
the pound, for goodness sake get the most for your money. 


But Remember This 


In the long run, first, last and all the time, what constt- 
tutes getting your money's worth in a meter purchase, is 
not price but performance. A poor meter entails 
three evils: It increases the cost of repairs and 
maintenance; it diminishes the revenue because it 
does not register small streams, and finally it renders 
the meter and water department unpopular—to the 
annoyance and disgust of the consumer and the water 
department employee. If you would like to have 
placed before you, in a plain, straightforward way, 
some facts of vital interest to every user or prospective 
user of water meters, send your address to The 
Neotune Meter Company, 90 West St., 
New York, and you will receive several 

pieces of printed matter which you will find cy 


very well worth your careful examination.

The Agency of a United People 


A striking comparison between a homo- 
geneous country and a_ heterogeneous 
group of countries is obtained by placing 
over the map of the United States the map 
of Europe. These represent the same area 
—about 3,000,000 square miles—if a few of 


the remote provinces of Russia are omitted. 


Europe has the advantage in popula- 
tion, with more than four times as many 
people as the United States; in the num- 
ber of large cities, with two and a half 
times as many cities of over 100,000 
population. 


Yet the United States, a comparatively 
young country, has outstripped Europe in 
the diffusion of civilization, because of its 
wonderfully greater means of communi- 
cation between all parts of its area. The 
United States not rch nao in transporta- 
tion facilities, but it has nearly three timesas 
manytelephonesasEurope, orabouteleven 
times as many in relation to population. 


By the completion of the Transconti* 
nental Line we now talk from one end of 
this country to the other, while in Europe 
the longest conversation is no farther than 
from New York to Atlanta. and even that 
depends on the imperfect co-operation of 
unrelated systems. 


Europe, with twenty-five countries and 
many different languages, serves as an il- 
luminating contrast to the United States, 
with one language and a homogeneous 
people, despite the fact that our popula- 
tion has been derived from all parts of the 
world. 


During the last forty years the steadily 
extending lines of the Bell System have 
contributed in no small measure to this 
amalgamating of different races. The 
latest achievement—the linking of coast 
to coast—has given greater force to the 
national motto, “E Pluribus Unum.”

eight or ten years ago has produced wonderful 
esults, as shown by the fall in the tuberculosis 
death rates In the city of New York the 
death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis has 
fallen from 2.37 in 


2 1900, «6to: 6100 In I19!3 
Though this decrease is gratifying, there are 
signs of beginning public apathy due to the 


mistaken impression that but little remains to 
be done. Thoughtful students have long real- 
ized that more must be done to strike at the 
underlying causes of tuberculosis In this 
city, particularly, we must continue to work 
for improving housing conditions. Our transit 
problem has a very detinite relation to tubercu 
losis, and we will be measurably nearer our 
goal if we can provide decent suburban hous 
ing conditions accessible to the business cen- 
ters. We are still far behind European cities 
in intelligent city planning. The conditions 
under which many of our working people labor 
add greatly to the solution of the tuberculosis 
problem. The increasing cost of food deserve s 
serious consideration.” 


And here is

how the Department of 


Chicago relates the science of 
political economy to the science of health in 
its monthly bulletin for December last 


If you have a vacant lot, what are you 
with it? Has it occurred to you that 
there is some better use it may be put to than 
to let it lie idle and pay taxes on it? Of course 
this is not the growing season, but next spring 
will be; and then what are you going to do 

If your lot lies out on the west, northwest or 
southwest sides of the city, the soil is good 
and it will grow all kinds of vegetables. Why 
not, then, put the vacant lot to some good us«

vacant lots. Man is dependent on the soil for 
his living. Let us then make the land pro

\ volume recently received from London 
gives important testimony to the attitude of 
leaders in British civic life as to the rela- 
tionship between the city planning and pub 
lic health movements. This volume * is the 
report of the Imperial Health Conference 
held in London last May under the auspices 
of the Victoria League The entire con- 
ference was devoted to a consideration of 
the problems of public health under the two 
aspects of town planning and the care of 
child life. About 130 pages of the report 
are devoted to the Section on Housing and 
rown Planning. The point of view of the 
Victoria League in thus relating city plan- 
ning to public health is perhaps best 
cated by 


indi 
these two paragraphs from the

excellent paper by Mr. Raymond Unwin: 

There are to-day two tendencies at work in 
ur existing towns: one towards concentration 
of industry and commerce, because it is found 
that concentration increases their ethiciency ; 
the other, towards the distribution of popula 
tion, because only so can the health and pleas- 
ure of life be secured; for while concentration 
f commerce increases efficiency, concentration 
f population, when carried beyond a certain 
point, tends to decrease vitality. This brings 
us at once face to face with the problem of 
transit; it is the modern facilities for rapid 
and cheap locomotion which have made pos 
sible the present degree of concentration of 
business, and will make possible, equally, the 
degree of distribution of population which ts 
necessary for health.” 

: se * 


“| have said that town planning will affect 
the length of life of the citizens and the health 
of their children. I may say that the universal 
experience, both in the Garden City at Letch 
worth and in various garden suburbs that have 
been established now for some years, is that 
the death rate, both infantile and general, is 
less than in the most healthy of other urban 
areas, and that the condition of the children, 
as indicated by size and chest measurement, is 
superior to that found in other districts.” 


In the other section of the Conference a 
similar desire was evident to discover causes 
rather than to cure diseases. In his intro 
ductory remarks, Chairman W. H. Hadow 
emphasized the paramount importance of 
the proper care of child life: 


For one thing, it touches almost every side 
f social welfare. It touches housing, and 
diet, and education in the fullest sense of the 
term. It is largely a medical question. /t is 
if I may venture to say so, even more largely 
a question of economics. As has been well 
said, infant mortality is the sensitive index of 
the social progress of a people.” 


Expressing his pity for the “people 
who go through life wooing a coy and re- 
luctant health with a clinical thermometer 
and a pocket ful of smal! white tabloids,” 
Mr. Hadow pointed out that the Conference 
had been called to advocate the maintenance 
of a saner and more successful method. 


+ + 


We all want better health for our fami- 
lies and our townspeople; we all believe 
that a well-planned, sanitary city is a more 
healthful place in which to live than a hap 
hazard, squalid one. Why not use this 
point of agreement as the starting place for 
the kind of public health 
which everyone can

upkeep and maintenance charges of the 
pavilion. 

Bathing pavilions, if the sanitary condi 
tions of the river permit, may be built to 
accommodate in segregated locker rooms 
men, women and children, with separate 
entrances and exits to the water-front for 
the sexes, and provided with adequate 
showers and rest rooms. Instruction in 
swimming and diving may also be offered 
at a nominal cost. The Metropolitan Park 
Board of Boston has at Revere Beach ad- 
mirable facilities for supplying towels. 
bathing suits and locker keys from a cen 
trally located head house; the success of 
this venture was demonstrated by the fact 
that large additional locker space was of 
necessity provided this last season. In this 
type of development valuables are deposited 
in sealed envelopes with the officer in 
charge on the way to the lockers, and the 
entrances to the beach and the exits there- 
from pass under the roadway and are not 
open to the general public from the beach. 

Restaurants and lunch rooms, properly 
controlled by license and by sanitary laws, 
are usually provided on areas of this type, 
especially if comparatively far distant from 
hotels and similar conveniences of the city. 
Even here, if private capital feels that con- 
ditions warrant their erection, hotels, with 
proper regard for their setting and archi- 
tectural character, could well be built. 

At Hamburg, Germany, about the Alster, 
a body of water consisting of two lakes, has 
been formed the recreational center of the 
city, where in the evening and on holidays 
the population gather at the cafés which 
line the banks, there in an orderly and quiet 
manner to enjoy the refreshments offered 
and view the pleasure craft as they dart to 
and fro. 

Other entertainment facilities, unknown 
in many cities, are afforded by the Charles 
River Bank, already mentioned. Here on 
the Charles River occur the annual races of 
the Harvard and other college crews, and 
on such days the wide walks of the Boston 
side are alive with a crowding, surging, 
race-mad array of men, women and chil 
dren, eagerly striving to view the start and 
finish of the races. A wide parking, attrac- 
tively planted, is bordered by a roadway of 
adequate width, which forms an avenue 
where ardent supporters may, from the 
higher vantage point thus afforded, in their 
automobiles view the river front. It is to 


be hoped that other cities will profit by a 
early mistake of Boston—that of permitting 
the none-too-attractive back yards of th: 
sadly out-of-date apartments to abut 


and thus mar this otherwise attractive 





way. It is only fair to say that the 
of the Charles River have not always beet 
so attractive, and that it was chiefly through 
the efforts of Charles Eliot and the con 
stant encouragement which he _ received 
from the Metropolitan Park Commissioners 
that the present delightful design was 
evolved. 


Promenades and Embankments 


In the architectural development of th 
shores of lakes and other large inland bodies 
of water, promenades and embankments 
effectively used in the treatment of rivet 
fronts may again prove invaluable Phe 
scale of the design in some cases, however 
would be much broader, inasmuch as the 
concentrated nature of the area, if con- 
fined to a restricted extent of the usabk 
lake shores, requires provision for a large 
number of citizens. The members of th 
community so attracted in large numbers 
can surely find few more rejuvenating and 
uplifting moments than those spent amidst 
such inspiring surroundings. Here the) 
may enjoy the pure air of the lake breezes, 
the varied play of light on the surface of 
the water, roused to numberless ripples and 
white caps as the restless tugs, swift yachts, 
or slow moving barges, dart or plod through 
the waves. 

The photographs and sketches (Figs. 4, 5 
6, 7,9, 10) well show that ample space is de 
manded where these fatigued citizens may 
stroll comfortably in large numbers, wher« 
others near at hand can drive in safety, and 
where still others can sit at their ease, 
studying the faces of the passing throngs 
Strangers though the pedestrians may be 
they take great delight in joining in the 
promenade, and. walking back and _ forth 
with their friends, and perchance enemies 
for where could personal grievances be so 
easily and happily forgotten? 

3udapest, the capital of Hungary, divided 
as it is by the river Danube, saw as early 
as 1873 the benefit assured the city by far 
sighted planning, and the river banks were 
bordered by stone quays, upon the highest 
portion of which is a wide promenad 
whence by stone steps the passenger em

Part of the river's banks, even at this

The Water-Front Park 

In contrast to the strictly architectural 
treatment of the lake shore, which would 
naturally be more or less confined to that 
portion immediately adjacent to the water, 
is the parklike treatment, more informal 
and naturalistic in its design. From an 
esthetic point of view a lake or water-front 
park, however meagre its equipment, if the

real pleasure. Here in the shelter of the 
quiet, tree-shaded nooks, far from the noise, 
smoke and dirt of the city, we may view 
the ever-shifting shipping and boating, the 
huge heavy-laden steamers with their loads 
of grain, ore or merchandise, and the pleas- 
ure yachts and motor boats as they dart in 
and out among the statelier craft. How 
much freer the air; how stimulating the 
breeze from off the cool water of the lake; 
what pleasure we attain in the evening, 
watching the million gleams reflected from 
the lights of a passing tug! Not only are

Winter sport facilities, in the colder cli- 
mates of the north, are much in demand 
among those accustomed to exercise in the 
brisk and sharp winter air. Ice-boating, 
with the thrills and vivid excitement which 
it offers in the races, and skate-sailing, with 
its attendant risk of mishap, are neither too 
angerous to be encouraged. Skating, if 
succe ssfully prov ided, necessitates the flood 
ing of the roughened ice if frozen during 
a windy day, requiring shoveling and clean- 
ing off strips of ice after snow storms, de- 
mands pavilions for refreshment and com 
fort, and perhaps a stadium or some such 
architectural feature of this type from 
which hockey games, ice-boat races, and the 
like, may be viewed with enjoyment. 

From the brief discussion presented 
above, we can see that any type of treat- 
ment of the water-front, whether it be lake, 
river or canal, must be suited to local condi 
tions; hence the greatest care is necessary 
to guard against mistakes. This may best 
be done by the employment of competent 
experts, whose broader knowledge and ex- 
perience enable them better to cope with 
the given problem.

Philadelphia’s Second Annual Clean-Up Week 


By R. Robinson Barrett 


Chiet Inspector of Nuisances, 


N conducting Philadelphia’s second an

year, a committee of three men, represent

were: John Neeson, Assistant Engineer of

the grand cleaning up. They were advised 
that this material would be collected on the 
days of the regular ash and waste collec- 
tions. Arrangements were made with all 
the contractors collecting waste and ashes 
in Philadelphia to put on many hundred 
additional teams to take care of the excess 
material during this week. Special teams 
were arranged to remove rubbish where it 
had lots. All the 


municipal buildings were given a thorough 
cleaning, and all the offices and desks of the

The Safety Crusade in Brooklyn 


By Mrs. Jessica P. McCall 


Supervisor, Bureau of Safety, Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company 


HE Children’s Safety Crusade in the 
public schools of Brooklyn, which 
was begun in the spring of 1913 by 

the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company with 
the approval of the Board of Education of 
the City of New York, has grown into an 
effective and influential campaign. From 
it included specific and detailed 
safety instruction in the schools, the forma- 
tion of Safety Patrols among the older boys 


the start 


and the distribution of literature 


children. 


Brooklyn Committee of Public Safety 

\n important step was taken in the fall 
of 1913, when the Brooklyn Committee of 
Public Safety was formed, including the 
President of the Board of Education, the 
Commissioner of Bridges, the Deputy Com 
missioner of Police assigned to Brooklyn, 
the Superintendent of Highways and sev- 
eral members of the public schools admin 
istration; also representatives of the Prot 
estant and Catholic churches, of the Brook 
lyn newspapers, the Bench, the District At- 
torney’s office and the Bar, besides banking 


among 


and insurance interests and the large de 
partment The chairman of the 
Committee was General George W. Win- 
a member of the Board of Education 
and the organizer and head of the Public 
\thletic League. 

In January, 1914, the Board of Educa 
tion issued to the Brooklyn Committee of 
Public Safety the authority to conduct, un- 
der its auspices, safety instruction in the

under the joint conduct of the Brooklyn

1. Schools and playgrounds (public and 
sectarian )

subjects suggested by the titles enumerate 
above. 
Safety Lessons 

Objective teaching was employed in the 
chools. The lecturer was provided with 
model street car, a gas stove, a fire 
box and original accident drawings ‘ 
objects taken up in turn kept somethi

children were quickly made to feel at h

was stimulated and sustained. With the 
models practical demonstrations were given 
of the dangers of the street car and the vas

accident drawings visually impressed all t] 
points, such as the correct and incort 
ways of getting on and off street cars. th

a Careful Club a candidate must meet cer 
tain requirements as to knowledge of 
dangers and of safe methods of action. 

In order to bring more individual atten- 
tion to the subject, prizes have been offered 
to the pupils of the two highest grades in 
each school for the best composition on 
Safety, the prize to be presented to the 
school by the pupil winning it. This plan 
appears to have no elements of selfishness, 
hut rather to be instrumental in developing 
a community spirit, as the prize is an ever- 
present expression of the pupil's interest in 
a great movement for the welfare of hu- 
manity. Suitable acknowledgment is made 
to the pupil writing the composition by in- 
scribing on the prize the record of the 
pupil's name and the presentation 

Safety bulletin boards have been sent to 
the public schools, on which are posted 
weekly bulletins prepared by the Supervisor 
of the Bureau of Public Safety, and also 
daily notices of any dangerous conditions 
in the school community, warnings and ac 
counts of accidents which the children ob- 
serve. The reports of accidents are accom- 
panied by written suggestions for prevent 
ing similar happenings. Stories illustrative 
of different dangers have been sent out in 
pamphlet form; for example, “A Caravan 
Journey and a Thunder Storm,” wherein 
the evolution of lightning is given, the prop- 
erty of electricity explained, and attention 
called to its great force for good as well as 
harm. 

The coéperation of the parents is secured 
through a special association for them con- 
nected with the school. They are invited to 
discuss, in an intimate way, any problems 


they wish to have solved in connection with 
the matter of safety, and they are made to 
feel that they are a direct help in the work. 

Letters explaining the undertaking and 
offering cooperation with municipal en- 
deavors in the safety field were sent to the 
lifferent city departments, from all of 
which were received prompt and practical 
responses. 

lhe general public has been reached by the 
distribution of blotters inscribed with safe- 
ty cautions, buttons of artistic design rep- 
resenting the goddess of Caution protecting 
two children on an isle of safety, with the 
motto “Be Careful,” and calendars with 
eriginal accident drawings and _ safety 
slogans for each month. Probably the most 
interesting feature of the work has been the 
motion picture entitled “The Price of 
Thoughtlessness,” prepared by Mr. E. C. 
Clarke, of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit 
Company, and Mr. Roy Hanaford, of the

tion was taken pursuant to a plan sug- 
gested by Col. T. S. Williams, President of 
the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, 
k oking to the extension of the activities ot 
the organization so as to include not only 
the public safety field, but that of industrial 
safety also 

The Brooklyn Institution for Safety af- 
fords members the following advantages : 

First—A Safety Suggestion Service, com 
prising the periodical distribution of safety 
bulletins and reports, pictures and other con- 
crete expressions of the thought being given 
to the subject throughout the United States 
rhis is possible because of the codperative 
relations which the Brooklyn Rapid Transit 
Company, in addition to its membership in 
such organizations as the National Council for 
Industrial Safety, has established directly with 
scores of the largest companies in the country 
working in the safety field. 


Second—Cooperative study of various safety 
problems by means of expert committees 
chosen from its own membership as the pro- 
gress of the Institution's work brings to light 
such problems needing attention. 

Tlurd—The establishment of a Question 
Box, through which any safety problem puz- 
zling a member of the Institution can be sub- 
mitted to all other members, and to all the 
sources of safety activity with which the man- 
agement of the Institution is in contact, out- 
side the membership of the Institution. 

Fourth—Participation in, or the holding of, 
meetings, conferences or exhibitions, for the 
promotion of safety studies. 

Behind these immediate objectives, the 
Brooklyn Institution for Safety looks out 
upon an even wider ultimate field of useful- 
ness. It has not neglected, in the expansion 
into industrial safety work, the public safety 
campaign for which it came into existence. 





The Public Square at Bucyrus, Ohio 


By F. L. Hopley 


UITE often, in city building, a wholly 
laudable enterprise may meet with 
obstinate opposition. This was the 

case in the transformation of the public 
square at Bucyrus, Ohio, from a veritable 
hitching lot into a place of beauty. 

he Bucyrus square had been there for 
nearly a hundred years, always surrounded 
by hitching rails for farmers’ teams. After 
a time the surface of the square was ma- 
cadamized, but the hitching rails remained. 
rhe streets leading from the square were 
well paved with brick, but the square was 
left as of old. 

Chen the leading newspaper of Bucyrus, 
The Telegraph, photographed the square 
and had an artist draw in two beautiful 
parks. From this “improvement on paper” 
a cut was made, which was published to 
show the possibility of beautifying the cen 
tral point of the city. The project met with 
immediate opposition, principally from the 
property owners around the square, who 
were “sure” a park on the square would 
depreciate their property value. 

H. L. Weber, an ex-city engineer who 
had traveled extensively and had recorded 
his travels with a camera, took up the park 
idea and had lantern slides made showing 
similar beauty spots throughout the coun- 
try. He delivered a talk and had the slides 


shown on a screen. This won for him a 
three-column attack in a local paper in 
which a leading citizen accused him of try- 
ing to turn the square over to the two rail 
Way companies as a switching yard. 

Fortunately, in E, J]. Songer, Bucyrus had 
a mayor of determination, and plans were 
finally drawn for the parked square on the 
original lines of The Telegraph’s photograph 
and drawing. Bids were asked for and the 
contract was let, but immediate threats of 
injunction put the improvement in doubt. 

Papers for the injunction were drawn, 
but no one could be found who had nerve 
enough to stand back of the action, as other 
obstructionists had, in the past, been made 
very unpopular. The improvement was 
completed, and now not a single person can 
be found in all Bucyrus who has anything 
but commendation and praise for the parks. 
The kickers excused themselves with the 
assurance that they “had no idea the parks 
were going to be like that.” 

Bucyrus has received more commenda- 
tion from outside people about this improve- 
ment than about anything ever before ac- 
complished in the city. Interurban lines 
connect on the square. One line comes in 
from Cleveland and the other from Colum- 
bus, and passengers going through seldom 
fail to admire the improvement.

of the soil. The herds are not producing 
what they should. In Hampden County 
there were 11,771 cows in 1910 producing 
on an average but 3,800 pounds of milk, 
though they should average at least 6,000 
pounds per year. The cows have been de- 
creasing in numbers also, and at an alarm- 
ing rate. In one year this decrease has 
amounted to a thousand. 


Industrial New England Weakening 

The result is that milk and other farm 
products have been going up in price. The 
cost of living is soaring higher and higher: 
in fact, the situation has almost become in 
tolerable. The following quotation is typi- 
cal of many letters received at the League 
headquarters : 

“I work ten hours a day and often over 
time. I get 20 cents an hour. I have myself 
and wife to support. I scrimp myself in every 
way, go to the theater about once a year and 
yet am unable to save a cent of my wages for 
a rainy day.” 

One cannot but ask, What about the la- 
boring man with three or four or more chil- 
dren to support? Massachusetts to-day is 
producing only 25 per cent of what it con- 
sumes. Seventy-five per cent of its food 
supply must be imported from the West 
and South—meaning additional commis- 
sions, freight rates and deterioration in 
food. This is handicapping New England 
industrially in the growing competition of 
the West. 

\long with the decline in population and 
the economic resources of rural communi 
ties, there has gone on a perhaps even more 
serious decline in the sanitation, education, 
social, civic and religious life of the open 
country. The problem, therefore, that 
these men had to face was most serious. 

The constitution and by-laws of the 
Hampden County Improvement League 
have as their underlying principle the 
bringing together of the agricultural and 
industrial leaders in a joint effort to pro 
mote better farming, better business and 
better living conditions in the county as a 
whole, and especially in the rural com- 
munities. 

The League at once employed a Secre- 
tary and General Manager, an Agricultural 
Adviser, a Horticultural Adviser and an 
Office Manager, and secured the necessary 
equipment, including an automobile. The 


XN 


first thing to he undertaken was naturally

and the whole economic status of the fat

tor a little over a year and eight months 
lhe cost of the work has been $19,006, wit! 


an estimated net return of farm values and

farm crops of $546,767, which would not 


have come had it not been for this organ 
zation with its staff of efficiency men and 
the work that the farmers have done under 


their direction and inspiration 


Better Farming 

These efficiency men have gone around 
from farm to farm and have met farmers 
in groups, inducing them to put into oper 
ation modern methods. To build up the 
soil these men have found it necessary to 
urge the use of lime and recommend chemi 
cals and fertilizers. One man who had a 
hundred acres of hay put in 70 acres of top 
dressing according to the recommendations 
of the adviser. Thirty acres he did not 
treat in this way. This man raised 22/7 
tons of hay more per acre off the 70 thar 
he did off the 30 acres. It cost the farmer 
$700 extra to put in the top dressing and 


to carry on the extra work, but he got 
$3,200 more for his hay than he would hav: 
had without this treatment 
land, with the use of 16 


properly 


Thus this farn 
tons of chemicals 
applied, netted an _ additional 
$2,500. Farmers in Hampden County ha 
been induced to use over 500 tons of chemi 
cals in a similar way. Potatoes and other 
crops have multiplied from 100 to 200 pet 
cent in response to the treatment recon 
mended by the advisers. Over 70 carloads 
of lime have been brought to the county as 
a result of the efforts of the League 

Orchards are being renovated and new 
orchards are being planted. One young 
man netted $150 from a cluster of trees as 
a result of carrying out the instructions of 
the Horticultural Adviser, from which he 
had never been able to net more than $5 
before. Thousands of trees in every part 
of the county are now being sprayed 
pruned and fertilized that were neglected 
before. The dairy has received the sam: 
kind of attention. The poor stock is being 
eliminated and high bred cows and bull 
are being introduced. The League is jus 
about to employ a poultryman to do for the 
poultry industry what the men thus far have 
done for the soils, herds, orchards and 
crops.

Large numbers of boys and girls have 
been drifting from the country to the cit)

social condition in the open country, such 
as is already taking place among the men 
One farmer said at a meeting where thers 
were 200 business men present: 

“It means much to me to be able to make 
$2 or $3 where | have made $1 before. It 
means much to my wife and to my children, 
but it means more to me to have you men 
come out into the country as you did, and to 
invite me to come here as you did. It is 
obliterating the line of demarkation between 
the farmer and the business man and is bring 
ing us together shoulder to shoulder.” 

In a number of communities the League 
has organized committees on agriculture, 
on good roads and transportation, on educa 
tion, recreation and civic affairs. And it 
will be the aim ultimately to bind together 
all these interests, so that city planning and 
town planning will all join hands, and that 
there may be a county-wide movement foi 
civic improvement. One farmer said 

“Before the League was organized, people 
thought that our town had no future. Most 
of them were trying to sell out and to get 
away. Now we see great possibilities for our 
selves and also for our community, and we 
are all enthusiastic, believing that our town 
is a good place to live in and that our farnis 
and our homes have a future.” 

It is the bringing together of the business 
men and the farmers in a county-wide or- 
ganization, creating a new spirit and enter- 
prise, that will rebuild the countryside and 
strengthen the industrial life. 


The Spreading of the Movement 

As a result of the accomplishments of the 
Hampden County Improvement League, 
many other counties in Massachusetts and 
Connecticut have formed similar organiza 
tions, and the League has received inquiries 
regarding the organization from as far west 
as Washington, as far south as Texas and 
as far north as Canada. It is now publish- 
ing a weekly paper known as the County 
League Adviser. This paper portrays the 
work that is being done and the results that 
are obtained, and aims to help along the 
kind of work undertaken by the League. 
It is a highly specialized paper that is rap 
idly becoming a great power in the promo- 
tion of the League work 


Great Agricultural Industrial Exposition 

As a result of the interest created among 
the big business men of Springfield in this 
kind of work, there has been organized 


what is known as the Eastern States Agri 
cultural and Industrial Exposition Chis, 
too, was started by the Springfield Board of 
lrade. This exposition has purchased 122 
acres of land within twenty minutes’ walk 
of the Springfield Post Office. The trans 
portation facilities are of the very best. 
lhe exposition will be far more than a first 
class fair. It will be an exposition that 
will give expression and inspiration to the 
best industrial and agricultural lines that 
the East can produce. lhrough demonstra 
tions, exhibits and educational work there 
will be shown in a concrete and lifelike 
manner the best processes of manufacture 


and the best ways of growing, breeding, 
handling, marketing and consuming. 

Special emphasis will be placed on the 
boys’ and girls’ department, with their ag- 
ricultural, home-making, manual training, 
vocational and recreational activities. It 
will develop Eastern States champions 
along all these lines. 

The exposition will conduct a sales mar- 
ket, where the blue ribbon stock from the 
eastern and many of the western states will 
find an excellent market. Already the 
National Dairy Show and the International 
Live Stock Exposition are considering 
Springfield as an eastern branch of their 
great institutions. 

lhe grounds, race track, athletic field and 
buildings will form a great and adequate 
arena for the assembling of large crowds, 
making an ideal place for big football 
games, baseball games, conventions and 
many other activities—especially affording 
a place where it will bring together county 
wide organizations with their competitions 
and activities. These leagues are develop 
ing very rapidly throughout New England, 
and will furnish an excellent reinforcement 
to the exposition. 

lhe physical development of the fair will 
be on a permanent basis and will be devel- 
oped from year to year under the direction 
of the best architects. Concrete and steel 
will be used in the more important build 
ings, permanence and beauty being com- 
bined. 


rhis exposition will aim to stimulate the 
agricultural, industrial and civic develop 
ment of this section of the United States, 
and will endeavor to give them the force 
and strength that unified effort and power 
alone can give.

Points of Difference in Water Works 
Franchises

Consulting Engineer, Columbus, Ohio 


N the year 1890 there were in the United any value. The writer was retained as ap

works properties in operation, or in pro nicipality where such was the attitude as-

view of the fact that comparatively little position. Unfortunately it is true that, from

costs of service rendered to different classes 
of consumers is an engineering and ac- 
counting problem, and it is seldom that the 
municipal authorities—or even the officials 
of the water works properties themselves— 
are experienced in and capable of making 
reliable estimates of such costs. 

The period of time for which a franchise 
is in effect is also an important element to 
be considered, especially in those states 
where capital invested in public utilities has 
little or no protection. When franchises 
are for limited periods of time and where 
the question of renewal always confronts 
the owners, it is not surprising that the ma- 
jority of privately owned water works prop- 
erties are not able to meet the demands for 
increased service brought on by growing 
communities. It is probably not an exag- 
geration to say that 75 per cent of such 
properties operating under franchises of 
limited or short terms are not capable of 
meeting the reasonable demands of all ser- 
vices at all times. This is because the own 
ers hesitate to increase their investment, 
knowing that they stand the possibility of 
not getting it back again in the near future 
This feature is eliminated by the indetermi- 
nate franchise—which, of course, should 
contain some compensating feature for the 
protection of the community served, such 
as the privilege to purchase the properties 
at such times as the community may select. 





Need for Engineering Advice 
In conclusion, it is the wish of the writer 
to call the attention of city officials to the 
difficulties in the matter of preparing a 
franchise and contract acceptable to both 
parties interested. It is undoubtedly true 


that ninety per cent of the litigation over 
water works matters has been on account 
of poor service generally rendered, and that 
this poor service has been attributable to the 
lack of protection of the owner who does not 
feel justified in increasing his investment. 
lt may be taken as an axiom of water works 
operation that inadequate revenues always 
result in poor or inadequate service. The 
consumer has the right to stipulate what 
service he may demand, but the owner also 
has the right to require that he be paid 
for the cost of service rendered, including 
as a part of that cost a reasonable return 
upon the value of the properties provided 
to furnish the service rendered. What such 
service properly shall be, and what may be 
the reasonable cost entailed by furnishing 
such service, all are matters of computation 
and accurate analysis. 

It seems on the face of it, therefore, ab- 
surd for municipal authorities to endeavor, 
as they frequently do, to solve for them- 
selves their local water works problems and 
to enter into new agreements with the local 
water works companies without the as- 
sistance of competent engineers who have 
made the solution of such problems their 
life work. Such assistance always is util- 
ized by the owners of the properties, who, 
therefore, have a great advantage in pre- 
paring and presenting their side of the 
question unless similar assistance is avail- 
able to the community. With competent 
engineering advice available for each side, 
there should be no very great difficulty in 
preparing a franchise and contract which 
will assure for the community adequate and 
proper service and which will guarantee for 
the utility a proper and reasonable revenue. 





Reduction of Typhoid 


Grand Rapids Progress, the bulletin of 
the Association of Commerce of Grand 
Rapids, Mich., publishes in its February 
number a tabulation of the cases and deaths 
from typhoid fever from 1907 to 1914, in- 
clusive. The statistics used in the article 
were compiled by Chief Chemist Walter A. 
Sperry of the Grand Rapids Filtration 
Plant. The table shows that during the six 
years prior to 1913 there was an average 
of 202 cases of typhoid fever and an aver- 
age of 27 deaths from typhoid fever an- 
nually per 100,000 population. Since Janu- 


Fever in Grand Rapids 


ary I, 1913, with the filtration plant in use, 
there has been an average of 128 cases and 
20 deaths annually per 100,000 population. 

It is pointed out in the article that the 
reduction would undoubtedly have been still 
more striking if all of the wells now being 
used in the city were condemned. A short 
time ago 707 wells in the Sixth Ward of 
Grand Ranids were analyzed, and of these 
440 had to be condemned. It is believed 
that the well water still used in Grand Rap- 
ids is the greatest cause of the compara- 
tively few cases of typhoid fever which are 
still occurring in that city. 























A Step Towards Solving the Industrial Housing 
Problem 


By Warren H. Manning 


Landscape Designer, Boston, Mass. 


HE allotment described in this article 
is being built by the Goodyear Tire & 
Rubber Company, of Akron, Ohio, to 

provide better homes for its employes with- 
in a reasonable walking distance of the fac- 


tory on more favorable terms than real 
estate dealers would offer. 
[he company wished to assist its em- 


ployes to own their homes in about fifteen 
years through regular payments, and to 
provide an additional insurance payment to 
protect the home in the event of death. By 
starting with 100 houses of about ten dif- 
ferent types, lower bids were secured, and 
employes enabled to make a choice that 
would determine the best types for future 
building operations. 

\t all stages of the undertaking the ad 
vice and approval of the employes were 
sought on plans and costs by displays on 
factory bulletin boards, in the employes’ 
paper, The Wingfoot Clan, and by discus- 
sion and inquiry among employes

upland on two sides, that Mr. Seiberling 
has set aside, planned, and partly con- 
structed for a playground, with a place for 
a public school. To the south of this area 
is a cemetery. That, however, is hidden 
by a high bank that will be planted. Smaller 
playground and park areas have been set 
aside in the residential districts, also a tri 
angle at the intersection of the principal 
streets, where lots are reserved for the 
local business center. Just across from the 
northeasterly corner is the new city high 
service reservoir and its park. 

The electric railroad from 


the city passes 
the factory doors, and the plan provides for 
its extension over the bridge and through 
the allotment 

This area is planned to become a part of 
the city of Akron, the new main 70-foot 
street to be an extension of the city’s main 
street in width, its general direction being 
toward the old hilltop town of Tallmadge 
To accomplish this it was necessary to ac 
quire quite a number of houses on a short 
connecting street 

The twenty-one streets have been made 
as direct and convenient as possible; they 
have been so fitted to the hills and valleys 
as to reduce the grades to the minimum 
and make a close-at-hand cut-and-fill bal 
ance to lessen the expense of construction. 
In the planning special attention was given 
to the street-end views, such as fine trees, 
distant buildings and landscapes, future 
buildings, etc As a few feet in location 
would throw an objective point out of the 
street-end views, this kind of study required 
a careful adjustment of lines on the ground

before the plan was finished. All streets 
have been provided with sewers, storm 
drains, water and gas mains, of modern 
approved types, with the advice of F. A. 
Barbour, who planned the city’s new water 
system. Telephone and electric service is 
provided for streets and houses by over- 
head wires. All streets over entire develop- 
ment are paved with slag, tarvia bound, 
which makes them sound- and dust-proof. 
Sidewalks, curbs and gutters are of con-

a total of 5 miles of paved streets in this 
development.

for each lot. To this was added the pro- 
portional cost for streets, sewers and other 
improvements, making the value of each lot 
from $450 to $950, depending on the size 
and location. The value of the house and 
lot thus ranges from $2,000 to $3,000 or 
more. A first mortgage running fifteen 
years and a second mortgage running 12 
years are placed upon a property, to be paid 
off in semi-monthly payments, which de- 
crease after the first five years. To prevent 
speculation, the payments for the first five 
years are figured on a real-estate value, 25 
per cent above cost of the property, rather 
than on the actual cost, but this extra pay- 
ment is at the end of five years to be sub- 
tracted from the amount due. The company 
is carrying at its own expense fire and tor-

Business Administration of 
Schools 

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.—The Municipal 
Research Committee of the Minneapolis 
Civic and Commerce Association recently 
conducted a survey of the business adminis 
tration of the public schools in Minneapolis 
The report to the Minneapolis Board of 
Education on the survey indicates that this 
included studies of the operation, mainte- 
nance and construction of buildings, of the 
purchasing, storing and distributing of the

supplies, and of the handling of th 
of the Board of Education lo 1 


accounts 
ake these 
studies, it was found necessary t 
carefully the procedure and methods 
in the business executive's office, the audi 
tor’s office, the supply house, the repair shop, 
and in the supervisor’s offices so far as they 
have to do with the business a 
of the schools. 


Iministration 


The principal recommendations of the 
Municipal Research Committee wert 
follows: 


1. The business executive, under the super 
intendent, should be placed in charge of all the 
business affairs of the Board of Education. He 
should be given definite authority to act, and, 
within the lines of authority delegated to him, 
he should be held strictly responsible for the 
successful operation of his division of the 


schoo] administration 


2. A segregated budget should be prepared, 
roperly classified, so as*to show as far as pos 


sible the objects and character of the proposed 
expenditures. This budget should be the con 
structive program of the financial policy and 
plan of work which the Board proposes for the 
scal year. With such a program the Board 


could hold executive employes responsible for 
accomplishing the work outlined 

3. The position of overseer of buildings 
should be created The entire time of this 
ficial should be spent in the supervision of 
the operation and maintenance of buildings 
Under the business executive, he should be re- 
ponsible for maintaining the school plant in 
proper condition and for operating the heating,

ventilating and other equipment to the best ad- 
vantage. 

4. Supplies, equipment and material used in 
the schools should be standardized, and uni- 
form specifications should be adopted for use 
in purchasing and distributing supplies. Stand- 
ardization should begin with the articles which, 
by use, have become standard. New standards 
adopted should be applicable to future pur- 
chases and should not interfere with the use 
of equipment and supplies now on hand. 

5s. As far as possible all stores should be 
delivered through the central supply house to 
insure careful inspection as to quantity and 
quality. A testing laboratory should be estab- 
lished where stores may be given physical and 
chemical tests. 

6. Provision should be made for obtaining 
cash discounts when bills are paid. 

7. The accounting should be reorganized so 
as to show clearly and accurately the financial 
condition of the Board with respect to property 
and other assets and the relation of liabilities 
and commitments to budget allotments. The 
cost of operation and maintenance should be 
determined from expense vouchers and reports 
of goods consumed instead of from invoices. 

The Board of Education has accepted the 
report as a working basis for reorganizing 
the business department, and has instructed 
the new business executive to codperate 
with the Bureau of Municipal Research in 
putting its recommendations into effect. 
Work has already been begun on installing 


new systems of stores and repair shop rec- 
ords. + + 


Suburban Day 

WaterLoo, Iowa.—The plan of having 
what is called a “Suburban Day” among 
the merchants of Waterloo was put into 
effect recently by the Waterloo Retail Mer- 
chants’ Association. Wednesday of each 
week was designated as Suburban Day, and 
on that day, by common consent, induce- 
ments are offered by the merchants in the 
way of special prices on certain articles in 
their stock. In some instances the mer- 
chants withhold specials until Wednesday 
and offer them to the public on that day. 

Suburban Day is made especially attrac- 
tive to out-of-town shoppers. Advertising 
of the subject and of the bargains to be 
had on that day is confined almost exclu- 
sively to the country editions of the news- 
papers. It is felt that people living in the 
city learn of the sales anyway, and out-of- 
town people are given an opportunity of 
visiting the stores on some other day than 
Saturday, which has formerly been the bus- 
iest day. This arrangement also proves a 
satisfactory one to the merchants, for the 


reason that it relieves the stores of some of 
the congestion on Saturdays and gives them 
two good days in the week instead of only 


one. ++ + 


GLens Faris, N. Y.—The Chamber of 
Commerce of Glens Falls has also inaugu- 
rated a Suburban Day for the benefit of 
out-of-town shoppers. Codperation was ac- 
corded by the officials of the electric railway 
into Glens Falls whereby reduced round trip 
rates on the electric railway from towns 
within a radius of twenty-five miles of 
Glens Falls, good on Wednesdays after 
March 24 for two months, were put into 
effect. The reduction in transportation 
rates will no doubt induce many people to 
trade in Glens Falls on Suburban Day, and 
there is the usual offering of bargains in 
standard articles as an added attraction. 

The special bargains are advertised in a 
full-page codperative advertisement in all 
the local papers throughout the territory 
from which Glens Falls draws its trade. 
Each merchant is allowed the same space 
in the advertisement, and the expense of the 
whole is prorated among them. A few of 
the larger merchants are offering a refund 
fare proposition in connection with Subur- 
ban Day.

A Farmers’ Meeting 

BattLe Creek, Micu.—The desire of the 
Agricultural Committee of the Battle Creek 
Chamber of Commerce to bring about a 
closer affiliation between the farmers and 
business men in Calhoun County culmi- 
nated in a meeting in February, at which 
700 farmers, members of the Central Farm 
Bureau, foregathered and participated in 
the discussion of current events in the 
county. There was a session in the morn- 
ing, afternoon and evening of the day on 
which the meeting occurred, each of which 
was made of as much interest to the far- 
mers present as possible, including a ban- 
quet, held at noon, and addresses and dis- 
cussions upon agricultural topics. 

The Central Farm Bureau is composed 
of all the farmers’ organizations—granges, 
gleaners and farmers’ clubs—within a ra- 
dius of fifteen miles of Battle Creek. The 
organization of the Central Farm Bureau 
is an achievement of the Agricultural Com- 
mittee of the Battle Creek Chamber of 
Commerce, and has been the means of dis-

central Pennsylvania. Huntingdon has 
many advantages: a location at a trunk line 
of railroad, a good train service, cheap 
power and a prosperous surrounding terri 
tory. Its advantages, however, have nevet 
been advertised, and no consistent attempt 
has ever been made to show the farmers in 
the surrounding territory the advantages of 
trading in Huntingdon instead of with the 
mail order houses. Huntingdon contains 
many progressive, wide-awake citizens; in 


fact, its average of citi-

the advantages that could 
be secured for Hunting

would be practically im- 
possible to secure the co-

Che American City Bureau addressed their 
appeal to civic patriotism rather than to the 
local desire for increased population. The 
results secured were remarkable. Over 285

was secured from practically every man in 
the city who could afford to pay the dues.

* ‘Made in U. S. A.”” Trademark 

Detroit, Micu.—The Detroit Board of 
Commerce offered a prize of 9500 to the 
artist who should submit the best “Made in 
U. S. A.” trademark design that could be 
used by every American manufacturer and 
advertiser. The award was made to the 
successful contestants, Clowry Chapman 
and James Harley Nash, of New York City. 

The design, as will be seen in the illus- 
tration, consists of an American eagle with 
wings extended on which appear the words 
“Made in,” and underneath the eagle ap- 
pears the name of the city and the letters 
“US. A.,” the whole symbolizing an Ameri 
can shield. It is the intent of the Detroit 
Board of Commerce that the design shall be 
adaptable for use in any city in the country 
by substituting the name of that city for the 
word “Detroit.” 


DETROIT 


IN 


The design is available for lithographic 
or color process, can easily be woven into 
textile fabrics as a label in color; it can be 
reproduced by zinc or copper process, and 
is adaptable for use as a stencil, metal 
stamp or die. The design is also elastic 
in that the name of the city can be omitted 
or widened or contracted, and is thoroughly 
American in atmosphere and composition. 
Its merit of simplicity and legibility will 
doubtless be a strong argument for its adop- 
tion and use on American merchandise in 
foreign trade.

it the Prosperity Dinner which the Wheel- 
ing Board of Trade served to its members 
on the evening of March 1. 

lt is asserted that nearly everything 

served at the dinner was made or grown 

1e Wheeling district. To add to the in- 
terest of the occasion it is said that the 
caterer was born in Greenbrier County and 
raised in Wheeling, also that the waiters 
vere all natives of Wheeling. 

Che musical program consisted of selec- 
ions by a local orchestra and the singing 
of familiar songs, the guests being fur- 
nished with leaflets containing the words. 
\ few of the songs were written with 
Wheeling as the theme and after the meter 
of old familiar airs. The first verse and 
chorus of one of the compositions, entitied 
“Boosting Old Wheeling,” sung to the tune 
of “Marching through Georgia,” are here 
given: 

Sing a song for Wheeling, boys, with all the pride 
we feel; 
Sing oon our bustling mills, our stogies, glass and 


Sing, but also let us put our shoulders to the wheel, 
While we are boosting Old Wheeling. 


CHORUS 
Hurrah, hurrah, we'll make the wheels go ‘round, 
Hurrah, hurrah, we'll win more men and ground. 


So we'll build a city, boys, more worthy of renown, 
While we are boosting Old Wheeling.” 


There were brief addresses by well- 
known Wheeling men, and the occasion was 
full of enthusiasm and promise for the 
future. The speakers included the mayor, 
a banker, a printer, a farmer, a minister, a 
lawyer, a manufacturer, a publisher and 
another well-known citizen.

Treasurer’s Report 
Orean, N. Y.—The Olean Chamber of 


Commerce, in publishing and distributing 
generally its treasurer's report for the fiscal 
year ending February has established a 
precedent in commercial organization cir- 
cles which might wisely be emulated. The 
report is a frank statement of the receipts 
and disbursements and of the assets and 
liabilities of the Olean Chamber of Com- 
merce. The public is thus informed as to 
the wisdom or the lack of it which is used 
in financing the organization’s affairs, and 
being assured of the former, will not hesi- 
tate to give the organization the support 
which is its due. 

Among other things the statement shows 
expenditures for modern office equipment,

Visits to Manufacturing Plants 

SPRINGFIELD, Mo.—In order to get the 
business interests of Springfield, Mo., better 
acquainted with the manufacturing enter 
prises of the city, the Springfield Club set 
aside Tuesday of each week for two months 
for visiting the various plants. The mem- 
bership of the club met at noonday lunch 
and at one o'clock about two hundred mem- 
bers were taken in automobiles to visit two 
plants each week. It is surprising to learn 
how very little the busy business man really 
knows of his home city. At each plant the 
visitors were received by the management, 
and plenty of guides and full instruction 
and demonstration were given. lhese 
trips took the visitors through bottling 
works, iron works, stove works, wagon and 
furniture factories, laundries, telephone ex- 
change, water works, etc. 

“See Springfield, Missouri, First’’ was a 
popular slogan that made for two invalu- 
able business assets: knowing one’s own 
city better and getting the business men 
better acquainted with each other

A Broad Program of Work 

Mount CLemens, Micu.—In preparing 
its program of work for 1914, the Mount 
Clemens Business Men's Association de- 
parted somewhat from the beaten path and 
ignored the tradition which decrees that it 
ts impossible to adapt the policies of a large 
organization such as the Chicago Associa- 
tion of Commerce, the Boston Chamber of 
Commerce, or the Detroit Board of Com- 
merce to a city the size of Mount Clemens. 
The new secretary of the Business Men's 
Association, Clifton D. Jackson, ventured 
to do just that, however, and in drawing 
up the outline of activities for the year 
1914, persuaded his directorate to follow as 
closely as possible the course pursued by the 
Detroit Board of Commerce. It is inter- 
esting to note in scanning the summary of 
accomplishments based upon the plan of 


organization work adopted in the early 
of 1914 that this ambitious idea was jus- 
tified. It is said that a man is as great as 
the number of his interests—which would 
seem to be equally applicable to a commer- 
cial organization. Once the activities were 
suggested and set in motion, results fol- 
lowed as a natural consequence. 

lhe program of work resolved itself into 
three main divisions, with their subdivi 
sions, as follows:

Safety as a Community Asset 

\ notable feature of the constructive 
work undertaken by several chambers of 
commerce throughout the country is the in 
creasing attention paid to matters of public, 
private and industrial safety. As_ time 
passes, the accident prevention movement 
acquires greater momentum, until now the 
slogan “Safety First” is known throughout 
the length and breadth of the land. 

But this slogan cannot remain in the | 
swaddling clothes of mere precept—it must 
develop into actual practice. Only then 
will its full significance be lived up to, so 
that the utmost community benefit may be 
dérived from its constituents of humanitar 
ianism, conservation and economy. 

The National Safety Council is the rep 
resentative national body whose aim is to 
coordinate and stimulate the accident pre 
vention movement in all its branches. To 
supplement the activities of the central 
office, twenty Local Councils have already 
been established in various cities. The ef- 
forts of these Locals are directed towards 
the diminution of all classes of accidents

Housing and Town Planning in Canada 
A Résumé of the History and Present Position of the Movement 


By Thomas Adams 


Town Planning Adviser, Commission of Conservation, Ottawa 


S previously stated in THe AMERICAN 
> City, the Commission of Conserva- 
tion of Canada has taken up housing 
and town planning as an important branch 
of its work. The following notes give some 
idea of the recent history and progress of 
the movement in the Dominion. The prog 
ress has not been so great as it might have 
heen in most of the provinces and cities, 
owing to the preoccupation « f the legisla 
tures and local authorities with matters con 
nected with the war. In spite of this, how 
ever, considerable activity is taking place in 
some of the provinces, particularly those of 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 


Nova Scotia 

Since the passing of the Town Planning 
Act in May, 1912, it has been a disappoint- 
ment to the people of Nova Scotia who are 
interested in town planning that no use has 
been made of the act, and at a recent con- 
ference the conclusion was arrived at that 
the act was not quite workable in its pres- 
ent form. It was, therefore, decided to sub- 
mit an amended act to the legislature during 
the current session, and this is now being 
done. If this amended act is passed it will 
be the most advanced legislation on the sub- 
ject of town planning, probably in any 
country. 

Phe draft proposes to make it compulsory 
for every city, town or municipality to ap- 
point a Local Town Planning Board, and 
such Board must, within three years after 
the passing of the act, prepare a set of town 
planning by-laws for adoption in its area. 
These by-laws have to deal with (1) fixing 
building lines on all existing roads sovas to 
secure, as far as practicable, that the dis- 
tance between the buildings to be erected 
or reconstructed on opposite sides of the 
road shali not be less than 60 feet and shall 
not exceed 100 feet; fixing building lines 
on all new roads so that no building shall 
be nearer the centre of any main thorough 
fare than 40 feet, or of other roads than 30 
feet; (2) reservation of land for new main 
thoroughfares, limitation of houses to the 
acre, securing adequate light and air to 


[884] 


windows, prescribing areas to be used for 
residential purposes or factories, etc.; (3) 
providing for variations in the width of 
streets so as to give owners of land the 
opportunity of laying out narrow streets of 
short length where such streets are not re- 
quired for through traffic. The Commis- 
sioner of Public Works of Nova Scotia has 
the power to prepare a set of model by-laws 
for submission to each municipality, and the 
municipality may adopt these instead of pre 
paring its own by-laws. 

\part from these compulsory clauses, the 
act follows the precedent of the British act. 
and it exempts any authority which pre- 
pares a town planning scheme from prepar- 
ing town planning by-laws. In certain re- 
spects the provisions of the British act are 
strengthened. For instance, “any land” 
may be included in a scheme, and not merely 
certain classes of land. The provisions 
with regard to compensation have been im- 
proved, and a schedule is annexed contain- 
ing regulations as to expropriation of lands. 

he effect of this act, if passed, will be 
to secure that the whole province will auto 
matically come under either town planning 
by-laws or be dealt with under town plan- 
ning schemes. The great advantage of this 
is thate every local authority is secured 
against ‘the inaction or indifference of every 
ther ‘authority, and that the small local 
authorities which are too poor to employ 
experts or to prepare elaborate maps can 
secure all they want by the mere adoption 
of a series of protective regulations. It 
is believed that in effect this method will 
secure the best results of town planning if 
the larger cities proceed with the prepara- 
tion of schemes, leaving the more rural parts 
of the area to be governed by town plan- 
ning by-laws 

It is not proposed to set up any new pro- 
vincial town planning department in the 
province, but to place the control of pro- 
vincial machinery under the Commissioner 
of Public Works and Mines, who is already 
the authority in regard to highways.

Board of Control proposes to ask for power 


to prescribe a certain portion of the city

endeavoring to get legislation incorporated 
in the city charter for this purpose. This 
is in addition to the powers already pos 
sessed by the Board in connection with the 
official plan of the city. lhis plan lays 


down building lines in the areas already 
built upon, and deals with other matters 


New ‘Brunswick 
\ town planning act was passed in New 


i 


Brunswick in 1912. The absence of any 
definite action on the part of any of the 
cities in New Brunswick is probably duc 
to the difficulties created by the somewhat 
novel procedure involved in preparing a 
town planning scheme. The New Bruns 
wick act is a good one, and there is no 
reason why a satisfactory scheme should 
not be prepared under it. It is satisfactory 
to learn that St. John, the largest city in 
New Brunswick, has decided to take steps 
to prepare a scheme under this act. A Town 
Planning Commission has been appointed, 
consisting of the Mayor, two commissioners 
and two ratepayers, and a resolution has 
been passed that the Commission apply to 
the legislature for authority to prepare a 
scheme. The Board of Trade of St. John 
has approved of the steps taken and the 
movement has enthusiastic support from the 
press and the public. A large area has been 
selected, comprising an area taking in all 
the unoccupied land within the city limits 
and considerable portions of the county 
parishes adjoining both sides of the city 
A map of the area is being prepared by the 
engineer, and early application will be made 
to the provincial authorities. This will be 
the first application to prepare a town plan 
ni 


g scheme in legal form in Canada, and 
St. John has the opportunity of giving a 
lead on this matter to the whole Dominion

Town Planning.—There is no town plan 
ning act in Quebec. 

Housing —An act has been passed to 
assist in the construction of dwelling-houses 
in cities, town and villages. This act pro- 
vides that the Council of any municipality 
may guarantee the loans of a company 
formed for the purpose of erecting dwell- 
ing-houses. It must be proved that addi- 
tional houses are required and its dividend

wn Planning.—No town planning act 
has been passed, but certain powers ar 


given to the Municipal and Railway Board 
ler the “City and Suburbs Plans Act’ 
to supervise the subdivision of land within 


five miles of a city having a population of 
not less than 50,000 inhabitants The act 


is of comparatively small value in securing 
the proper planning of even the few cities 
to which it applies 

Housing —The “Act to Encourage Hous- 
ing Accommodation in Cities and Towns” 
was assented to on 6th May, 1913. This 
ct corresponds to and was passed prior t 


the act of the Quebec Legislature which 
is described above 

lhe Toronto Housing Company has beet 
formed to operate under this act and has 
successfully carried through two important 
housing schemes. The value of the com 
pany’s work will be as much in providing 
an object lesson in house building as in pro 


viding additional houses where they are 
much needed.

In addition to the above legislative pow

in several cities 


provinces, been 


taken 


Montreal—In Montreal there has been a 
City Improvement League in existence for 
some time, and efforts have been made to se- 
cure a plan for the city and island. Chiefly as 
a result of its efforts the Quebec Legisl: ature, 
in 1910, appointed a commission to enquire into 
the need of such a plan, and the commission 
recommended the appointment of a Metro- 
politan Park Commission to prepare and to 
execute plans for a greater Montreal. Later, 
a joint Social Survey Commission was formed 
to compile statistics and survey of the needs 
and conditions of Montreal. 

Ottawa.—In 1903 a report was prepared for 
the Improvement Commission of Ottawa by 
Mr. F. G. Todd, which is a valuable town 
planning document. A Town Planning Com- 
mission was appointed by the Federal Gov- 
ernment in 1913 to prepare a plan for a greater 
Ottawa, and the report of this commission has 
been presented to Parliament. 

Winnipeg.—The Second Greater Winnipeg 
Town Planning Commission was created by 
the Board of Control of Winnipeg early in 
1914. It is preparing a plan, under the advice 
of Professor Stoughton for an area compris- 
ing 200 square miles, and expects to bring for- 
ward proposals for town planning legislation. 

Edmonton, Calgary, Berlin, Brantford and 
Selkirk.—Plans have been prepared for these 
cities and their environs, but no definite steps 
have been taken to give them practical effect. 
The report prepared for the Calgary City 
Planning Commission by Messrs. Mawson & 
Sons was only submitted in April, 1914. The 
report is a very fine production, and the com- 
mission seems to have spared no expense or 
effort in investigating the local conditions and 
in having a scheme prepared for the future 
development of the city. The Brantford re- 
port has just been completed by Mr. Dunning- 
ton Grubb, and the Selkirk report by Professor 
Stoughton. 

Banff.—The Dominion Parks Branch has 
obtained plans for the layout of the town of 
Banff prepared by: Messrs. Mawson. 

l’ancouver.—The Civic Center Committee of 
Vancouver recently promoted a competition 
for designs for a civic center, and a series of 
excellent designs was submitted. The report 
of the assessor, containing the prize designs, 
will shortly be issued. 


Toronto.—A Toronto-Hamilton Highway 


Commission has been appointed by the Ontario 
Legislature to carry out a scheme for con- 
structing a new road from Toronto to Ham-

ilton go miles long. The road is now in course 
of construction. It will be 66 feet wide, with a 
cement pavement of 16 feet in width. 


Future Work 

lhe Commission of Conservation is pre- 
paring a collection of topographical and 
other maps and city planning reports with 
a view to making it suitable for exhibition 
in all the large cities in Canada. 

With regard to the work which will be 
taken in hand by the Commission during 
the current year, consideration has to be 
given to the difficulties created by the war, 
and to the financial stringency which exists 
in the Dominion in connection with muni- 
cipal affairs. This is a good time to prose- 
cute the work of investigation which should 
precede town planning and housing legisla- 
tion, all the more so because of the inac- 
tivity in building operations. 

Among the proposals which were agreed 
to at the last annual meeting of the Com- 
mission of Conservation was one relating 
to the organizing of an annual Town Plan- 
ning and Housing Conference under the 
auspices of the Commission. A conference 
will probably be held during the present 
year, 

At the last annual meeting it was re- 
solved to recommend each Provisional 
Government to create a Department of 
Municipal Affairs corresponding with the 
Local Government Board of Great Britain, 
whereby the best expert advice would be 
placed at the disposal of municipalities and 
expenditures on municipal projects and 
improvements would be subject to approval 
of a central provincial department. 

Such departments are already in exist- 
ence in Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba. They are much needed in the 
other provinces to secure uniformity of 
administration and procedure, the employ- 
ment of skilled advisers, the linking up of 
public health, housing, highway, boundary 
extension and town planning administra- 
tion, the proper control of public utilities, 
the framing and application of sanitary 
and other by-laws on sound principles, 
wider powers to municipalities and the 
efficient and impartial presentation of 
municipal accounts. 

The Commission has prepared a draft 
Town Planning Act and this is now being 
submitted to the various provincial legis- 
latures, as opportunity arises.

The Need for Neighborhood Centers in 
American Cities 


By Anna Pendleton Schenck 


T has become a trite saying that modern 
demands of life have disintegrated the 
family. It is as true that modern mate- 

rial progress has disorganized neighbor- 
hood life—more so, perhaps, in the larger 
communities, but to some extent in all com- 
munities. 

The present-day student of sociology is 
hopeful that out of the chaotic elements of 
the twentieth century family a_ broader, 
nobler idea of family life will be evolved. 
It is not too much to believe that our scat- 
tered neighborhoods have in them the 
germs of a finer and more inspiring com 
munity ideal. When we realize that the 
framework of the nation is based upon the 
union of self-governing communities, each 
with its divisions and subdivisions, down 
through the smallest group, the family, to 
the individual, we cannot fail to see that 
every one of these units has its place and 
function in the larger national life. Among 
them the neighborhood group is next in 
importance to the family. It is historically 
the first expression of national existence 
to follow the patriarchal period. To-day 
its many possibilities are too often over- 


looked in our schemes for municipal de- 
velopment. 
In a small town it is possible for all the 


public activities to be brought into one 
group, which forms a civic as well as a 
neighborhood center. In a big city there 
will inevitably be many things which re 
main outside of neighborhood life. Che 
increase of rapid transit facilities gives the 
resident of even remote suburbs reason- 
ably quick access to a central district where 
are situated the art museum, research li 
brary, stock market, city hall, court house 
and other institutions which it would be 
extravagant folly to duplicate even in a 
metropolis, and many of which smaller 
communities must needs do without alto- 
gether. On the other hand, nearly all the 
constantly used activities of the dweller in 
the city could be brought within easy reach 
of their homes. An economic concentra- 
tion of these activities, and an intelligent 
management of them, are what is needed 
to create a neighborhood center and to pro 
mote the neighborhood pride which is the 
foundation of patriotism. 

The elements which constitute a neigh- 
borhood center may be divided roughly into 
two groups: those which contribute to the 
material welfare of the individual and, 
through him, of the community; and those 
which help to foster his intellectual or 
moral growth. The functions of these

overlap one another, but in a general way 
one may say that the first is composed of 
the institutions for the carrying on of local 
government, such as district courts, post 
office, and police stations; the conservation 
activities, which include fire stations, sani- 
tary and building inspections, hospitals and 
clinics; and last, but not least, the whole 
commercial fabric, the banks, offices, stores, 
factories. The second group has as its 
nucleus the school, for it is now recognized 
that the training of the child is the biggest 
factor in the development of the race. The 
function of the school is enlarged to in- 
clude an intellectual stimulus to grown 
people as well, in the reading room, library 
and museum, and in the night classes, lec 
tures, concerts, and art exhibits. The play- 
grounds and gardens for little children and 
the athletic fields and gymnasia for older 
people of both sexes are part also of the 
educative program. An auditorium, assem- 
bly hall and club rooms, a theatre and res- 
taurant and an ample provision for parks 
fill the recreational needs of a neighbor- 
hood center; while the churches or other 
places of worship, added to such philan- 
thropic institutions as suit the character of 
the district, supply the stimulus along spir- 
itual lines. 

While all the elements of this second 
group would not be maintained nor man- 
aged necessarily by the neighborhood as a 
whole, they are yet an integral part of a 


THE AMERICAN CITY 339 


complete neighborhood center. By wise 
forethought and careful planning they 
could be so brought into the general scheme 
as to harmonize with its architectural style 
and form a part of its beneficial influence 
upon the community. 

There is a great field for the neighbor 
hood center in American communities, both 
rural and urban, but there is a danger lurk 
ing behind the theoretic conception of such 
a development. Every neighborhood has 
its own class of people, its varied degrees 
of intellectual growth and material pros 
perity, its accidents of climate and topog 
raphy—in short, its own needs which must 
be met, and its own special possibilities 
which must be developed, if we are to pro 
duce a neighborhood center which will not 
be a mere added burden to the taxpayer, 
but fulfill its purpose of bettering the 
community financially, intellectually, mor- 
ally. 

It is such a neighborhood center which 
we have tried to create in the accompany- 
ing plans, based on a section of land in the 
borough of the Bronx in Greater New 
York, and which have been awarded the 
first place in the recent competition held 
by the City Club of Chicago. There are 
wonderful opportunities in all growing 
communities to foster the neighborhood 
center idea, and it is among our most press 
ing civic duties to raise, by this means, the 
standard of American neighborhood life.

This is the first civic center to be under-

illustrated here. 

The new home of the Police Department 
is designed on the lines of the Georgian 
colonial period, with exterior of red brick 
and white marble trim, and is set back far 
enough from the street to allow for a small 
grass embankment. The building in its ex- 
terior aspect has the pleasing atmosphere 
of a New England inn rather than a tem- 
porary home for derelicts. 


The structure is fireproof, consisting of 
steel framing throughout, with reinforced 
concrete arches. The finished floors in 
general are of cement and composition. 
The main or froft wing measures 38 x 100 
feet; while the smaller or prison wing in the 
rear is 31x 79 feet. 

The front doors open immediately into 
the muster room. The sergeant’s desk is 
on the left, and to right are doors opening 
into the patrolmen’s waiting room, which 
is equipped with tables and Windsor chairs. 
A built-in wooden bench: runs around all 
sides of the room. 

Facing the entrance are stairs of colonial 
design. From the muster room there is a 
connection through two corridors with the

when the cost fell much within the appro-

been completed without dispute or trouble

ics. It is thus a conspicuous example of a 
municipal contract to be executed with an 
absolutely unstained record. 





Alternative Bidding 


lo the Editor of Tue American City: 

In your March editorial you discuss the 
comparative merits of wide-open or alter 
native specifications for paving materials 
and other municipal supplies. The ques- 
tion of methods of bidding for municipal 
bonds is an important one also. Your read- 
ers may be interested in a recent Maryland 
decision involving the legality of a novel 
inethod of submitting bids. 

It seems that the city of Cumberland ad- 
vertised for bids on certain bonds to be 
issued. Several bids were entered, among 
others being one with the addition: 

“We make the following alternative bid for 
all or none of said bonds: one hundred and 
ifty dollars more than the city would receive 
from any other bid or combination of bids at 
this sale, provided that the price to be paid by 
us shall not be less than 98 and accrued inter- 
est, nor more than 99.80 and accrued interest.” 

This offer was accepted and all other bids 
rejected, whereupon an injunction was ob 
tained and upheld restraining the munici- 
pality from accepting this,bid in the form 
tendered. 

The general principles of* competitive 
bidding were discussed and the rules ap 
plicable were laid down in a decision con- 
demning the alternative bid as violating all 
principles sought to be safeguarded by 
sealed and competitive bidding conducted 
under quasi-judicial authority. In cases of 
this kind officials should conduct the whole 
matter with as much fairness, certainty, 
publicity and absolute impartiality as is 
possible. A bid in this form does not con- 


for Municipal Bonds 


form to these principles. A bid of this 
kind would not take effect until the others 
had been opened, and it would serve the 
end of justice as well were all bids first 
inspected by a bidder of this kind and he 
then be allowed to submit his. 

Under this form a bidder might just as 
well offer one dollar more than any other 
and the principle would have been the same. 
While excusing the bidders from any form 
of corruption in this case, it was pointed 
out that permission to receive and accept 
bids of this nature would open the door 
wide to all forms of favoritism, graft and 
peculation. 

It was also urged that in some particular 
cases this method may prove advantageous 
to the public. This view, however, was not 
taken by the court, which stated that, while 
this may be true in isolated cases, there is 
no such thing as a substantial compliance 
with the prescribed methods for making 
public contracts other than performance in 
substance of every condition precedent to 
such making regardless of the results. It 
was held that the action of the council was 
contrary to the spirit and intent of the plan 
of competitive bidding, and therefore, ultra 
vires, invalid and illegal. 

This case is reported in full in the Daily 
Record of Baltimore for February 26, 1915

cil of Cumberland et al. No. 7409 Equity,

ONE-LIGHT POSTS USED WITH STREET SERIES LAMPS FOR PARK AND BOULEVARD 
LIGHTING, SOUTH BEND, IND. 


The Influence of High Efficiency Lamps on 
Ornamental Street Lighting 


By Gilbert 


He recent development of high ef 
ficiency lamps has opened the way 
for the introduction or extension of 

irtistic lighting systems at a cost that is 
within the means of almost every city and 
town. This is exceedingly encouraging, for 
one of the largest items of expense in such 
installations is the fixtures. High efficiency 
lamps are made in sizes that permit wide 
spacing in outlying districts, thus reducing 
the cost of equipment to the minimum. 
lhe design of equipment is of paramount 
importance in the plan of a lighting system 
One must consider the size and general ap 
pearance of a city and predetermine the 
decorative effects to be obtained in the par- 
ticular section of the city to be lighted 
Most cities have wisely selected designs that 
harmonize with the surroundings, and in 
many instances it has been found that a 
standard of moderate cost filled the require- 


[342] 


T. Dunklin 


nents of suitability to best advantage 

Ingineering problems relating to the ser- 
ice obtainable from the local electric light 
plant, distances to be covered by the light- 
ing circuit, efficiencies of available illumi- 
nants and the amount of light needed to 
facilitate traffic with perfect safety and 
comfort must be studied carefully. For a 
brief discussion, it is convenient to consider 
these problems as applied to the lighting of 
streets in (1) business districts and (2) 


parks and residential districts. 


Business Districts 


Before the introduction of high efficiency 
lamps, ornamental lighting in business dis- 
tricts was done almost entirely with clusters 
of 110-volt lamps Here it is convenient to 
divide the system into sections, taking the 
electric current from several supply sources

as illustrated in diagram (a). In this way 
the loss of power in the service wires is 
not so great as would result by supplying 
current from a single low voltage source of 
supply to a large number of lamps distrib- 
uted over a large area. With the vacuum 
type lamps there is little difference between 
efficiencies of multiple and street series 
lamps. By properly spacing the standards, 
even illumination of sufficient intensity is 
obtained with clusters of three to five lamps 
varying from 40 to 150 watts each. In the 
large cities where the traffic is dense, the 
cluster lights are often augmented by the 
are lamps already installed at street inter 
sections. 

Since the introduction of high efficiency 
lamps, single light standards have become 
popular for the following reasons: (1) 
Single light posts are relatively cheaper 
than cluster posts. (2) The nitrogen filled 
lamps are much more efficient than the 
vacuum type lamps, especially the large 
sizes of street series lamps. (3) Single 


conductor cable is used for street series 
lamps, as shown in diagram (b); or two 


STREET LIGHTING SYSTEMS 


single-conductor cables may be used as i 

lustrated in diagram (c), and so connected 
to the lamps that all lights may be burned 
until midnight, when half of them are ex 
tinguished, the remaining lamps burning 
until daylight. In this way adequate illumi 
nation is provided when street traffic is 
densest, and a saving in current consump 
tion is effected by disconnecting half of the 
lamps after midnight. 

Aside from all engineering considera 
tions, both the cluster and single light posts 
have advantages typical of each styl 
hese must be considered for each particu 
lar installation. The cluster post has the 
advantage of display effects, and if proper! 
designed and installed has a very beautiful 
appearance both singly and in groups. ‘This 
is well illustrated in the case of Michigat 
Boulevard, | hicago, one of the most beauti 
ful stretches of “White Way” in the world

column of the post gives the appearance

method of grouping the lamps, however, is

wasteful of light, but a happy medium is 
found where a distance of thirty to forty 
inches is maintained between centers of 
opposite pendent lamps and a third or fifth 
lamp placed above the arms supporting the 
pendent lamps. 

It is less difficult to follow correct pro 
portions in designing single light standards

it is considered better taste not to obstruct

upon the width of the street and sidewalks 
and whether there are trolley poles to in-

the single light post 1s often pre ferred. 


Parks and Residential Districts 


In the resident portions, in parks and 
along the boulevards, series lamps are more 
economical because of the long distances

the supply source is laid along the thor 
oughfares to be lighted, and opened at each

which it started, thus completing the circuit. 
Diagram (b) shows such a series system. 
Single light posts or bracket fixtures are 
best adapted to the outlying districts for the 
following reasons: (1) High efficiency se- 
ries lamps are made in such a variety of 
sizes that single units spaced closely to- 
gether will afford adequate illumination for 
the residential portions of the city, where 
the traffic is not so congested as in the mer- 
(2) Single light standards 
if properly designed are in harmony with 
the surroundings and lend a dignified ap- 
pearance to the entire plan. (3) Single 
light posts and brackets are cheaper than 
cluster posts, both in initial cost and main- 


cantile centers. 


tenance, and are more easily wired for 
series lighting. 

High efficiency street series lamps have 
simplified the problems of park and boule- 
vard lighting and the manufacturers have 
met the situation with a large variety of 
designs. Many of these are distinctly origi- 
nal, both as to the ornamentation on the

A Successful Legislative Campaign for Fire 


Protection Funds 


N May or June next, on publication of 
the Statute Book of the IQI5 Legisla 
ture of the State of Kansas, there will 

go into effect the following act, which was 

signed by Governor Arthur Capper on Feb 

ruary 3: 

In Act relating to the maintenance and equip- 

ment of fire departments in cities of the 
second and third class, and providing for 
the levying of a tax for the maintenance 
f such fire departments and for the pur 
chase of equipment. 

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State 

of Kansas: 

Section 1. That the mayor and city council, 

r board of commissioners of cities of the 

second and third class, are hereby authorized 
and empowered to levy a tax in an amount 
not to exceed one-half mill on the dollar, as 
ther city taxes are levied, for the purpose of 
raising funds for the maintenance of a fire 
department, and for the purchase of fire en- 
gines, hooks, ladders, buckets and other fire 
apparatus and equipment; provided, that any 
such order or ordinance directing any such 
levy shall have a two-thirds vote of such city 
council or commission. ; 

SECTION 2. That said tax when -collected 

shall be paid into the city treasury and credited 
to a special fund, which shall be known and 
designated as “The Fire Department Fund,” 
and such moneys shall be expended and ap 
propriated by the mayor and council, or board 
of commissioners, and paid upon warrants 
drawn by the city clerk, upon such special 
fund, as other city warrants are drawn, for 
the purposes mentioned in section 1 of this act, 
and no other. 

SECTION 3. This act shall take effect and be 

in force from and after its publication in the 
statute book. 


The new law, it will be noticed, applies 
only to cities of the second and third class. 
Fire departments in cities of the first class 
are already provided with the power to pur 
chase the necessary fire equipment and 
maintain themselves in such a manner as to 
make them efficient instruments for fire- 
fighting purposes. In first class cities al- 
lowance is made for this in the yearly 
budget of expense and in making their tax 
levy. In cities of the second and third 
class, however, while the statutes provide 
that the city administrations shall purchase 
the necessary fire equipment and properly 
maintain the fire department in such cities, 
the money to provide for these things has 
heretofore come out of the general fund; 
and in such cities having an assessed valua- 
tion of over $2,000,000 the levy for the 


general fund is limited to two mills on the 
dollar, It is readily seen that this amount 
is inadequate for carrying on the business 
of a city and leaving very much, if anything, 
for fire equipment and maintenance. 

The Chairman of the Legislative Con 
mittee of the Kansas State Firemen’s Ass« 
ciation, George | Mohrbacher, of Marys 
ville, conducted the campaign for the pas 
sage of the bill. A circular letter in which 
the subject was thoroughly covered, and 
also i COpy of the proposed bill, were sent 
) the chief of every fire department in the 
State The chief was asked to show the bill 
to the senator and candidates for assembly 


‘ 


in his section, in order to familiarize them 


1 
SO 


with its contents, and to secure the signa 
ture of each one to the printed slip al 
enclosed, which stated that he had carefully 
gone over the proposed bill and would give 


it his hearty support when it came up for 


i 


passage. The chiefs were asked to return 
the signed statements in the stamped en 
velope sent them. About forty per cent of 
the statements were returned to the Chair- 
man duly signed. A great many letters 
were received from the candidates stating 
that they were in favor of the bill, but de 
clining to put themselves on record in ad- 
vance. The campaign for the measure was 
so successfully directed that practically no 
opposition was encountered when the bill 
was finally presented. 

The following is an excerpt from the 
circular letter referred to as sent out by the 
Chairman: 


“Think of how often the fire department in 
a city of the second or third class has gone 
before the city council or commissioners and 
asked for extra equipment—hose or something 
in the apparatus line, which is an absolute ne- 
cessity and would increase their efficiency 
only to get the answer: ‘Boys, we know you 
need it and we'd like to buy it for you, but we 
haven’t got the money. You'll have to get 
along with what you have for a while.’ And 
they are telling you the truth about it. Yet 
you and your department are expected to 
handle any fire that might happen to break out 
in your city. 

“This bill, if passed, will provide for just 
what it states—the maintaining and equipping 
of a fire department, whether it be paid, partly 
paid or volunteer. It does not make it obliga- 
tory to have the tax be the same each year, but 
the levy can be so made to cover the expense 
of whatever is necessary. 

“Tt will enable thoce who are in need of ad- 


[347]

ditional apparatus to procure same. Some of 
the departments are finding it necessary t 
have a paid man or two, or perhaps some partly 
paid, but have not been able to have them fot 
lack of funds. This bill will cover just such 
cases. In fact, it is intended to cover the ex- 
penses of the department for anything neces 
sary and legitimate. 

“If the levy should be made one-half mill, it 
would mean that a man who pays taxes on a 


thousand dollars’ worth of assessable property, 
would pay 50 cents towards the maintenance 
and equipment of the fire department in his 
city. Worth it, isn't it? The non-resident 
property owner would also contribute his share 
in the way of taxes, which he should, as his 
property has the protection the same as the 
‘faithful’ resident who is often willing to 
donate for the cause,’ especially in the smaller 
towns

A New City Planning Bibliography 

A valuable contribution to the bibliog- 
raphy of city planning is to be published 
this month by the National Conference on 
City Planning, prepared by Theodora Kim- 
ball, Librarian of the School of Landscap« 
Architecture, Harvard University. About 
one thousand references have been selected 
from many times that number with a par 
ticular view to their professionai value, and 
arranged according to the “Comprehensive 
\nalysis of City Planning,” by which the 
extensive city planning collections of the 
Harvard School of Landscape Architecture 
are classified. In this way Miss Kimball is 
making a presentation of the literature of 
city planning in its fundamental relations 
not previously attempted. The titles chosen 
refer to material which is useful and avail- 
able, representative, well illustrated, or sug- 
gestive of further material or particular 
points of view.

A Juvenile League Magazine 

\n ambitious step has been taken during 
the last year by the girls of the Clermont 
Post of the Waring Juvenile Citizens’ 
League—which is a committee of the 
Woman’s Municipal League of New York 
City—in the publication of a brisk and en- 
livening little monthly magazine devoted to 
the interests of the Juvenile League. The 
magazine carries advertising and is effec- 
tively gotten up. Besides sections report 
ing the various activities of the League and 
some general matter, there is a “Question 
Box” department, in which are answered 
questions regarding the work of the League 
which have proved puzzling to members 
For example, “What things should the 
members of the W. J. C. L. report?” 

Number of families in house and number of 
ash and garbage cans provided by landlord, 
and whether garbage cans have covers. 

Where public refuse cans are placed. 

Fire escapes blocked so that passage would 
be impossible, stating with what blocked. 

Cellars filled with inflammable materials or 
rubbish, or having water standing in them. 

Over-filled ash cans (they should never be 
filled higher than 6 inches from the top) or 
garbage cans without covers.

SANITATION 


We show illustrations of our Canco Trash Burner and Canco Fly 
Trap, two articles to help in the “clean up” campaigns which are 
spreading over the country. 


“CANCO” RUBBISH AND 
TRASH BURNER 


This is practically the only burner on the market that will withstand 
heat without warping, the body being made 


from ONE PIECE OPEN HEARTH SHEET STEEL. 

Owing to its peculiar construction it is 
practically indestructible. All joints of the 
burner are welded; no rivets to become loose. 





Canco Burner is the only burner which has 
a solid bottom, detachable base or pan. With 
ordinary burners the ashes are generally scat- 
tered around 
wherever the 
rubbish is burnt, 
making an un- 
sightly appear- 
ance. 


“CANCO” FLY TRAPS 


There are some that look like Canco 
but they are about as similar as a 
‘flivver’’ car is to a high speed racing 
car. First of all, the Canco is an all 
metal trap. No wood pieces to warp 
or rip off. It must wear and it'll catch 
more flies than Mr. Carter has pills. 
Joints are all electrically welded. It is 
made on strictly mechanical lines and 
after a careful study of other makes and 
their operation.

THE AMER 
Statistics of New York's 
Employment Bureau 
Figures showing the business done by 
the Public Employment Bureau of New 


York City in the 80 working days from the 
time of its opening on November 19, 1914, 
to the end of February, 1915, give a grand 
total of 20,542 applicants for positions, 
1,982 demands for workers, and 1,178 posi- 
tions reported filled. That is, the number 
of positions filled averaged about 14 for 
each day; a total of 804 positions remained 
unfilled and 19,364 applicants failed to ob- 
tain work. 

The greatest number of applicants for 
work in any one field came under the head 


of “trade and transportation” service. The 
number of applications here was 7,356; 
number of positions to be filled, 527; and 


positions reported filled, 293. Next in the 
number of positions which the Bureau was 
asked to fill came the field of domestic and 
personal service, in which the demands for 
workers numbered 450; applicants, 3,068; 
and positions reported filled, 233. There 
was a large number of applicants for manu- 
facturing and mechanical work: 4,217 ap 
plicants, 239 positions to be filled, and 142 
positions reported filled. In the building 
trades there were 119 calls for workers, of 
which 77 were supplied, from 1,690 appli- 

Out of 240 persons applying for 
agricultural work, 12 were placed, the de- 
mands for helpers numbering 18. Four po- 
sitions in professional service were filled; 
number of applicants, 66; 8 positions to be 
filled. Applicants not coming under any of 
the above classifications numbered 3,905; 
positions to be filled, 621; positions reported 
filled, 417. The proportion of male and 
female applicants was approximately 7 to I, 
although the number of males finally placed 
in positions amounted to only 796 as com- 
pared with 382 females, or a proportion of 
about 2 to I. 


cants. 


In explanation of the large number of 
applicants who failed to secure positions 
during these first three months, it should 
be borne in mind that the publicity given 
the project by the newspapers prior to the 
opening of the Bureau resulted in an ab- 
normal number of applicants seeking em

to employers.. The Bureau was not free to 


well 


spend money on publicity among employers, 
as this would have been in violation of the 
city charter. Some money was, however, 
obtained from the Mayor’s Committee on 
Unemployment with which to advertise in 
the daily papers, so that to-day the ratio of 
applicants for

positions reported filled, is increasingly in 
favor of the applicant for work. 

In the case of demands for solicitors and

rather indicated the number of

i with Barrett's Paving Pitch 


Waterproof under All Conditions 





ATER and frost will ruin any 

road if they get into the 
foundation. Because this is so, the 
filler is as important a consideration 
as the brick or block of which the 
pavement is made. For a filler that 
is not waterproof under all condi- 
tions occasions endless repairs, ex- 


pense and annoyance. 


Paving Pitch is the only filler that 
forms an absolute waterproof bond, 
winter and summer. 

In cold weather asphalt loses its ad- 


hesive quality, the brick shrinks 


away from the brick or block, and 
cracks result, letting the water in. 
In hot weather cement, being abso- 
lutely rigid, 


leads to cracks and 


“blow-outs”, due to expansion. 
Again the water gets in. 

Paving Pitch follows the block and 
clings to it in all weathers. It will 
outlast the pavement. Nor has it 
any defects as a filler. There is, how- 
ever, a big difference in pitch.

perial because the maximum _ tempera- 
ture is determined at the time of installa- 
tion. ‘lhe bather cannot raise the tem- 
perature of water beyond this pre-deter- 
mined point. 

The operation of the 


INGHAM 
SHOWER MIXER 


is controlled by one handle. Turning 
this indicator handle gives the bather any 
temperature desired without a moment’s 
delay. ‘That means a large saving in 
time and water. ‘This increases tre- 
mendously the capacity of your shower 
baths. 

The Safety, Simplicity and Economy 
of The Ingham Shower Mixer has caused 
its adoption by the Public and Private 
Institutions all over the country.

THE AMERICAN CITY 359 


Pan-American Road Congress 

The week of September 6 has been ten- 
tatively selected as the date of the Pan- 
\merican Road Congress, to be held at the 
Panama-Pacific International Exposition 
under the joint auspices of the American 
Road Builders’ Association and the Ameri- 
can Highway Association. 

rhe plans for this meeting, which prom- 
ises to be the largest gathering of good 
roads advocates ever held, are in the hands 
of an executive committee made up of 
Governor Charles W. Gates, of Vermont, 
Chairman; W. W. Crosby, formerly State 
Highway Engineer of Maryland; FE. L. 
Powers, Editor of “Good Roads,” repre- 
senting the American Road Builders’ As- 
sociation; James H. MacDonald, formerly 
State Highway Commissioner of Connecti- 
cut; and J. E. Pennybacker, Chief, Division 
of Economics, U. S. Office of Public Roads, 
representing the American Highway Asso- 
ciation. 

Both associations have held successful 
congresses independently heretofore, but it 
was felt that this year, in view of the 
Panama-Pacific International Exposition, it 
would best serve the interests of good roads 
advocates to hold a joint congress during 
the exposition.

Exhibit of Municipal Supplies to 
be a Feature of Mayors’ Meeting 

A municipal exhibit, the first of its kind 
in New York State, will be held in connec- 
tion with the sixth annual meeting of the 
New York State Conference of Mayors and 
Other City Officials, at Troy on June I, 2 
and 3. 

The exhibit will consist of implements 
and manufactured wares most commonly 
used and purchased by municipalities. 
Mayor Cornelius F. Burns of Troy has ap- 
pointed a local committee to have charge 
of the exhibit and act for the Conference. 
The exhibit will be held in the large drill 
shed of the Armory. Plans are being made 
so that the large apparatus may be easily 
removed to the street for demonstration 
purposes. 

The Conference is planning to make the 
exhibit attractive not only to the visiting 
officials, but also to the people living in 
the ten nearby cities connected with Troy 
by trolley. Allof the cities in the state have 


been asked to send motion pictures of thei 
principal municipal activities. These will 
be shown at the exhibit. 

The Conference announces that it is not 
its purpose to make this exhibit a paying 
venture, and that the charge will be only 
enough to cover the running expenses ot 
the undertaking. It further says in its an 
nouncement: 

“The benefits to be derived from exhibiting 
at this conference are apparent. It brings the 
products of the manufacturers in close touch 
with the 500 members of the municipal depart 
ments who will be present, and it is the only 
opportunity during the year that manufac 


turers have to demonstrate their products to 


all of the city officials of the Empire State 
C. R. Metzger, General Secretary of the Troy 
Chamber of Commerce, is secretary of the 
committee.”

Public Properties Exhibition at 
the Chicago City Club 


Over one thousand pieces of property 
within the city limits of the City of Chicago 
are used for and owned by the public. This 
surprising fact is graphically brought out 
on a large scale map which is the central 
feature of the “Public Properties” exhibi 
tion which opened on March 2 at the City 
Club of Chicago. The exhibition is a sort 
of graphic inventory of the great commun 
ity estate of America’s second city. It 
makes everybody a property owner and 
shows all citizens to be joint owners of 
about one-third the area of the city; the 
entire street system—which, lengthened out, 
would more than reach across the continent 
—being added to the thousand land parcels. 

The display of school buildings and 
grounds records the revolution which has 
taken place in a generation in the concep 
tion of a school building, and shows the 
great variety of types now in use. The 
park and playground pictures present as an 
entirety the unique recreation development 
for which Chicago has become world-fa 
mous. 

It is not solely a booster show. Some of 
the dark and foul quarters in which police 
prisoners and officers alike are compelled 
to stay are shown in contrast to the model 
police stations. Streets and waterways, 


electric light and water supply properties, 
properties for sanitation and fire protec 
tion, penal and charitable institutions, hos- 
pitals, libraries and museums and public

trated. 

rhis is believed to be the first exhibition 
of this sort ever attempted in an American 
city. It is designed to help both laymen 
and officials to see the possibilities in our 
great number and variety of public prop- 
erties and in their improved distribution 
and administration. 

lhe Neighborhood Center Competition 
drawings form a noteworthy feature of the 
exhibition. Several months ago the City 

lub announced a competition for plans for 
a Neighborhood Center, around which the 
community activities of a city neighbor 
hood might be organized so as to secure 
eficient community action and stimulate 
neighborhood pride and sentiment. Twenty- 
three sets of drawings were submitted.* 

\ series of discussions, open to the pub- 
lic, was held during the first week of the 
exhibition. These ended with a Saturday 
afternoon meeting, at which several speak 
ers discussed what well planned and man- 
aged neighborhood centers would mean to 
local trade, to industrial enterprise, and to 
the recreational, musical, dramatic and 
other esthetic needs of its general public 
and of its individual interests.

Out of Work; A Study of Unemploy- 

ment. (Revised edition with additional 

material.) 1915. 569 pp. $1.65 

Some of the errors in America’s unsuccessful at 

tempt to cope with the problem of unemployment are 
shown to be the disorganized nature of the efforts, the 
confusion of charitable aid of those unfit for employ- 
ment with relief measures for dealing with persons 
able and willing to work, but temporarily unemployed, 
and the survival of police methods in meeting an 
dustrial problem The extensive study of existing ct 
ditions—including especially interesting chapters on un 
employment among women, immigration in relation te 
unemployment, philanthropic and civic experiments, 
and employment agencies—is accompanied by detaile 
suggestions for readjustment. The author designat 
the municipality rather than the state as the prop 
local unit in the distribution of labor, and shows the 
urgent need of action by the Federal government 
communities, industries and individual citizens.

What a Million Mothers Avoid 


More than a million careful mothers have intuitively known the 
dangers of poisonous fly destroyers. They have known that such 
preparations contain arsenic in deadly quantities. They have real- 
ized the peril to little children that accompanies the use of fly poisons 

But for those who have not learned of these dangers, we quote 
from a recent issue of the Child Betterment Magazine, which com- 
ments upon 35 cases of children being poisoned last year: 


“The danger to children is great, and the danger to adults is by no means 
inconsiderable 


In the December issue of The Journal of the Michigan State 
Medical Society, an editorial on the same subject cites 47 cases 
and goes on to state 

‘*Arsenical fly poisons are as dangerous as the phosphorus match. They should 
be abolished. There are as efficient and more sanitary ways of catching or 
killing flies. And fly poisons, if used at all, should not be used_in homes where 
there are children, or where children visit.”

DRINKING FOUNTAIN IN WASHINGTON PARK, CHICAGO 


Bubbling Fountains in Chicago 

Chere are many and varied types of bubbling 
fountains at the present time on the market 
In the city of Chicago 600 bubbling fountains 
manufactured by James B. Clow & Sons, of 
Chicago, have already been installed. The type 
of bubbler is known as the Clow “Hygiene 
one-piece bowl and pedestal fountain, with a 
self-closing regulating stop valve. The dian 
eter of the bowl is 13 inches and the base is 12 
inches in diameter. The height of the fountain 
is convenient for the drinker, being 28% inches 
to the rim of the bowl and 30 inches to the rim 
of the bubbling cup. The fountain is turned 
out by the manufacturer ready for connection 
to the waste and supply lines. It is fastened 
to a cast iron base, which in turn is sunk in 
the ground to a depth of about 4 inches, and 
the supply and waste pipes are attached to 


this base. The waste connection is through a 
2-inch pipe, which is properly trapped to the 
sewer. The water supply pipe is % inch, and 


the supply is taken from the 6-inch supply t 
the fire plug. These fountains are located on 
all prominent crossings and have given great 
satisfaction. 

The same fountain has been adopted by 
many of the large industrial plants throughout 
the country, due to the facts that it is abso 
lutely germ-proof, is made of durable, attrac 
tive Adamantose ware, and has a self-closing 
faucet, which saves water consumed

cover a space of more than 450 acres, and are 


beds, 


located in the famous Fox River Valley, far 
enough north to insure hardiness and far 
enough south for good, substantial growth. 


After two years of care the seedlings are 
transplanted into rows about two feet apart 
\t the end of the first year thereafter they ari 
“root pruned,” a process which produces a 
mass of fibrous feeding roots, and thus in 
creases the tree’s nourishment. At the end of 
another year the tree is transplanted, and this 
process of root pruning one year and trans- 
planting the next continues as long as the 
trees remain in the nursery. This is claimed 
to be the secret of certainty of growth. When 
these evergreens are to be shipped they are 
taken, freshly dug, to packing cellars and pro 
tected by peat moss to conserve the moisture. 
They are placed in layers in a properly venti- 
lated box, with wooden cleats betwen the lay- 
ers. Thus the trees are prevented from being 
shaken around and overheated. 

This book is full of views which give sug- 
gestions for planting evergreens for wind- 
breaks, hedges, screens, etc., and differentiates 
the various species in an interesting way.

Orders for Fire Apparatus 


lhe city of Rockford, Ill, has recently o1 
dered one of the Ahrens-Fox Model K-2 auto 
pumping engines, which is the fourth piece of 
this make purchased by the Rockford | 
partment. The first auto engine bought by the 
city, which was the first one built by the 
\hrens-Fox Company, has been in_ service 
more than three years and is capable of meet 
ing the guaranteed capacity now as well as 
when it was delivered. A letter to the com 
pany under date of February 5, 1915, signed 
by Mayor W. W. Bennett and Fire Chiet 
Frank E. Thomas, transmits the contract for 
the new purchase, and speaks highly of the 
reliability of the apparatus already bought, and 
of the good and prompt service given by the 
company. 

\ thorough and varied test was recently 
made of the Ahrens-Fox model K-2 autom: 
bile pumping engine and hose wagon, which 
was afterwards accepted by the fire chief and 
the fire committee of the City Council of Beau 
mont, Texas. This is the same type of ma 
chine that was exhibited at the firemen’s cot 
vention in New Orleans, where it made a con 
tinuous run of six hours with a perfect score 
under the most exacting conditions. Some of 
the tests at Beaumont were made with tw 
lines discharging through two 1-inch nozzles, 
which pumped 780 gallons a minute, and threw 
the water an estimated distance of 230 feet on 
a horizontal line. With the two lines of hose 
connected and discharging through a single 
1%-inch nozzle, the water was shot a distance 
of 175 feet into the air. During a test made 
at the standpipe, which is 125 feet high, the 
water was thrown 25 feet over the top of the 
standpipe. The factor of especial efficiency in 
this apparatus is the high-pressure pump car 
ried on the front of the truck. This is a pis- 
ton pump, double acting, with four pump bar- 
rels connected in pairs with two crank shafts 
and providing three degrees of pressure

While the demonstrating 
crew of the Dayton Tri- 
Car Chemical, manufac- 
tured by the Davis Sew- 

















ing Machine Company, of 
Dayton, Ohio, were mak- 
ing a demonstration at 
New Paris, Ohio, recently, 
a telephone message was received at the engine 
house that the farm house of Samuel Roberts, 
6 miles from the village, was on fire, and that 
the adjoining buildings were in danger. The 
demonstrating machine started at once for the 
fire, and, in spite of the long run and rough 
country roads, arrived in time to extinguish 
the blaze, which was a roaring mass of flames. 
The adjoining buildings and barn would surely 
have been destroyed but for the timely arrival 
of the chemical. The citizens of New Paris 
were so pieased that the Mayor, W. H. Mc- 
Clure, and Chief Harry Collins, of the Fire 
Department, drew up a testimonial and sent it 
to the factory in Dayton, expressing their 
thanks and their high approval of the machine.

your park system by unsightly wires 
and poles to supply your lighting cur-

putting overhead wires underground? 


Have you considered the fact that 
underground wires and cables are not 
disturbed by storms and gales?

conduit and ean be installed for less 
than half the cost of cables with 
conduits.

100 Years is 
a long, long time— 


for a street or road sign to give 
service and to face the wind 
and storms of all seasons, day 
in and day out. Yet— 


Indestructible Signs are constructed from the rust- 
resisting iron “ Armco’ (American Ingot Iron), the most 
durable iron manufactured. The letters of the sign are 
drilled into the plate, then filled with bright aluminum, 
thus making them stand out clearly yet indestructibly 
and permanently. 

The letters can never be erased. Even though the outer 





Indestructible Signs 


are built to do this. They stand the test. 
in the year 2015, they will still be readable. 
or three years only—but one hundred years. 








“The Signs that 
Outlive Father Time’’ 


At the end of one century— 
They do not last for two 


coat of paint wears off, the letters always remain 
readable 


Your citizens need never complain of battered signs after 
once installing Indestructible Signs. Money which has 
been flowing from your treasury for new signs every two 
or three years can be stopped. Your city will not have 
to buy new signs for nearly 100 years.

CITY AND PARK TREES 
The trees of our cities and parks are becoming beautifully less from lack of care and attention, note 
the broken limbs and dead wood that strew the ground after a storm. 
I can remedy this condition by making an inspection, and furnishing experienced men to carry out 
the necessary work, or furnish directions from which local men can do the same.

PAVEMENTS 


are one of the most important factors in the welfare

Taxpayers ought to know more about the pavements

Claims in regard to pavements are valueless unless

Facts in regard to Trinidad and Bermudez lake asphalt 
pavements are easy to get, because about 200,000,000 
square yards of these pavements have been constructed 
in the last 35 years. 


An illustrated record of lake sheet asphalt that has
