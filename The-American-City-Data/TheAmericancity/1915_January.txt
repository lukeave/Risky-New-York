THE EFFECTIVE AUDIT OF MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTS AND THE 
SATISFACTORY USABLE SYSTEM 


requires not only thorough experience in municipal accounting and familiarity with the requirements of laws and

We invite inquiries regarding work we have done for municipal and business organizations.

hours and thirty-two minutes without a stop. 

We had a bad lumber fire Thursday evening 
at 6 P.Li. and the car went in service at that time, 
worked until 5:32 P.li. Priday, November 13th, which I 
believe makes twenty-three hours and thirty-two minutes. 

The car never stopped till we were ready 
to go home and never missed a stroke. It supplied 
three lines during this time. We consider this very 
excellent work. 

After returning from the lumber fire on 
Priday evening, the car went to another fire that same 
evening, and two the next day, and was ready for another 
twenty-three hours work after that. And confirming 
everything you have said about your triple the Chief and 
myself take great pride in having such an apparatus in 
our Department, as we feel when we take this apparatus 


to a fire we are sure to get good results at all times.

The merits of the Lambert have made water-meter systems popular. 
All improvements which the tests of time and long service show to be requisite in a Perfect Water 
Meter, are embodied in the Lambert. A good article is always worth the price. 


ONE QUALITY AND ONE MODEL ONLY. 


Made in all sizes $” to 6” of the best bronze Composition throughout, fitted with Unbreakable re- 
inforced disc-pistons. 





We firmly believe in ‘‘The Survival of the Fittest.”’ 
Here are a few reasons for our belief: 


Cleveland, Ohio, in 1912, awarded its entire contract for Water Meters, in Bizes 
5-8 inch to 6 inches inclusive, at a price several thousand dollars higher than that of 
the low bidder, to this Company. 
A differential in value based on quality of material used, on low cost of maintenance, on 
merit and general excellence of Lambert Meters ascertained in a practical way by service use during 
many long years, had fully demonstrated their ‘‘fitness to survive.”’ 


Water Company, under date April 29, 1913, say concerning it: 
“In a period of nearly twenty-three years, this meter has worked continuously night and 
day, with only two periods of repairs, one in 1905 and one in 1913, with a total record of 59,715,950 
cubic feet of water.”’ 


[ 2 | A 6-inch Thomson Meter, No. 8217, was set June 1, 1890, at Fort Adams, R.I. The Newport 


Three (3) 6-inch Thomson Meters set in December, 1902, at Kingsbridge Power Station, 
Interborough Rapid Transit Company, 216th Street and 9th Avenue, New York City, N. Y., 
are still in service and during said time have not required any repairs. 

The numbers of the meters and registered amount of water which has passed through them, are 


a. Sree 70,435,200 cubic feet 
le, rere 101,085,400 cubic feet 
SE SE Stk es wc es enseness 98,908,900 cubic feet 

BONES bess ween ver ceeseeen 270,429,500 cubic feet 


Undez date March 7, 1913, Mr. William Craig, Engineer in Charge, furnishes the foregoing details, 
and says: 

“They have been tested on several occasions by the Water Department, the last test being made 
on February 11, 1913, and found correct.” 

These three (3) meters, at a rate of 10 cents per hundred cubic feet, evidence a revenue to the City 
in the sum of over $270,000.00, for Water used and measured through them to that time. 

And no expense attached to the owners thereof, for repairs, during more than ten (10) 
years.

organization which lends itself to efficient ac- 
tion, and which at the same time places in the 
hands of the electorate simple and effective 
means for controlling their government in 
their own interests. The evils in city govern- 
ment due to defective and undemocratic organ- 
ization can thus be removed; beyond that, re 
sults can only be achieved through the growth 
of an active and enlightened public opinion.” 

It can hardly be doubted that the commit- 
tee’s recommendations will have a_far- 
reaching effect on city charter making—an 
effect which will be due not only to the 
intrinsic value of the report, but to the per- 
sonnel of the committee, which consists of 
William Dudley Foulke, A. Lawrence 
Lowell, M. N. Baker, Clinton Rogers 
Woodruff, Herman G. James, William B. 
Munro, Delos F. Wilcox, Richard S. Childs, 
A. R. Hatton, Robert Treat Paine, Mayo 
Kesler and John A. Fairlie. 


+ + 
The short ballot idea and the city man- 
ager idea have evidently “arrived.” And 


the next step forward—if we may venture 
the prediction—will be the adoption of the 
proportional representation method of elect 
ing city councils. Though merely suggested 
as a permissible alternative in the report 
of the Committee on Municipal Program of 
the National Municipal League, its advan 
tages were strongly emphasized in President 
Foulke’s annual address: 


“But where a whole representative body is 
to be chosen from the city at large, there is an- 
other method of securing more accurate rep- 
resentation than we can get either by the sys- 
tem of ward representation, so fruitful of 
small politics, or by a ticket at large where 
minority representation (so necessary for the 
watchful observation of city business) is alto- 
gether excluded. This other method is the 
system of proportional representation. 

“Up to this time proportional represen- 
tation has made little progress in American 
communities, but elsewhere it has been used 
with success, notably in nine of the cantons 
of Switzerland and in all its most important 
cities; in various representative bodies in 
Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, the 
Union of South Africa Transvaal, Tasmania 
and Wurtemburg, in Hamburg and certain 


communal councils in Baden, Oldenburg and 
Savaria, as well as in other places. It is ob- 
jected that the system is complicated and con- 
fusing, but it has not been found so in the 
places where it has been applied. Some years 
ago in one of the principal cities of Switzer- 
land, | asked whether the people were satis- 
fied and the answer was, how could they fail 
to be satisfied when under it every man had 
what representation he was entitled to.” 

The friends of efficiency and democracy 
in municipal government will agree that the 
council which chooses a city manager 
should in itself be truly representative of 
the voters. A recent leaflet of the Ameri- 
can Proportional Representation League 
suggests that this desired end can be at- 
tained by providing: 

(1) that nominations for the council shall 
be at large by petition, and 

(2) that any group of voters who vote to- 
gether at the election shall elect its fair share 
f the council. 

For example, suppose there are nine 
seats in the council. Then if a group of 
voters polls a ninth of the votes cast in 
the city, it gets one seat. If another group 
polls three-ninths of the votes, it gets 
three seats. To each group its fair share 
of the seats. 

To those who regard the Hare system of 
proportional representation as too cumber- 
some for municipal elections, the “list sys- 
tem” is recommended by the League. Cape- 
fully prepared nomination and election pro- 
visions for the list system are embodied 
in Leaflet No. 1, available on application.* 

To the first city to adopt proportional rep- 
resentation there will come, we believe, not

Chile’s Interest in City Planning 
By John E. Lathrop 


OTWITHSTANDING a é é serious 
business depression which began 
two years ago; notwithstanding the 

utter demoralization caused by the Euro- 
pean war, the progressive men of Santiago, 
Chile, are planning a radical and extensive 
transformation of that city. 

Throughout the Republic of Chile this 
spirit of progress is manifest. The tempo- 
rary recession of business, instead of dis 
couraging the formation of plans, has been 
seized as an opportunity to prepare for that 
resumption of activity which every sensible 
person knows will follow the signing of the 
peace treaty in Europe. 

When, therefore, this renewal of busi- 
ness health has taken place, Chile will be 
ready for the work of executing these 
plans. It is somewhat surprising, perhaps, 
that such far-seeing wisdom should be ex- 
hibited in a country which is small in ex- 
tent, and far from the centers of world 
activity. But the visitor to that South 


American nation.returns with understand 
ing of the causes which have aroused such 
commendable spirit. 

The same uprising tendency is lifting 
Chile which has brought into play, the world 
over, that which we have known in late 


years as “the progressive movement.” 


here, as in every other civilized country, 
is a group of men who are not content with 
the status quo. The formal droolings of 
the doctrinaire in politics and economy is 
losing its hold on thought in that far-away 
land. As everywhere else, the wisdom of 
the leaders is applying the science of the 
day and the learning of the schools to 
the demands of a1 


advanced sociology 
proceeding, in fact, on the truth that men 
and women, not systems of commerce or 
financial institutions per se, should be the 
first thought of government 

In July of this year the American City 
Bureau received a cablegram from the 
Primero Alcalde of Santiago, Don Ismae 
Valdez Vergara, asking for the city

to work to bring a better day for the urban 
life of their country. Their labors are vol- 
untary; their reward the consciousness that 
civic cleanliness and better health and hap- 
pier lives for the masses will be the result. 
Plans for the transformation of Santiago 
have been drawn by the Society Central of 
Architects and several Chilean engineers, 
and Ernest Coxhead, of San Francisco, has 
prepared one. The committee on the Trans 
formation of Santiago will procure many 
plans, and from them select the ideas which 
will best meet the needs of the city. 
Practically every modern idea relating to 
city building has been included in the scope 
of the preparations to transform Santiago. 
Excess condemnation will be employed to 
produce funds with which to cut a sys- 
tem of broad diagonal avenues to connect 
all the principal centers. These Chileans 
are avoiding wisely the error of planning a

La Exhibicion de Planos de la 
American City Bureau, en 
Santiago 
Durante los ultimos quince dias del mes de 
Septiembre préximo pasado ha estado abierta 
al publico en el gran salon del Palacio de Bel- 
las Artes, la Exposicién de Planos y Trazados 
para Ciudades que bajo el patrocinio del Con- 
greso de Gobierno Local, celebrado reciente- 
mente en esta capital, ha enviado desde New 

York el American City Bureau. 

El gran ntimero de personas que ha con- 
currido a la Exposicién — segtin calculos pru- 
dentes 15,000—es una muestra elocuente del 
interés que desperté su inauguracion entre el 
elemento culto del pais 

La forma eminentemente practica en que 
han sido coleccionados los distintos planos, 
fotografias y cuadros de estadistica que con- 
stituyen la Exposicion, ha facilitado consider- 
ablemente al publico el estudio detenido de 
cada una de las secciones en que esta dividida. 

Las explicaciones verbales del sefior John E. 
Lathrop, quién ha venido a cargo de la ex- 
hibicién, y un catalogo que se ha repartido 
gratis, han permitido a los visitantes darse 
cuenta cabal de los defectos que atin adolece 
nuestra capital y de la forma practica en que 
han sido correjidos en otras ciudades. 

Tanto el ingeniero como el magistrado, el 
propietario, el arquitecto, el artista, etc., han 
podido encontrar un ancho campo de ideas 
para preveer los resultados benéficos que puede 
traer a una ciudad el estudio detenido de la 
localidad en que esta edificada, de sus comuni- 
caciones con el exterior, de su saneamiento y 
aprovisionamiento de agua potable, de sus 
centros de recreo, educacién y cultura, del 
fomento y ubicacién de las fabricas indus- 
triales, etc. Cada una de las secciones que se 
relacionan con estos topicos contiene una serie 
de fotografias o planos elejidos entre los 
mejores de las diferentes ciudades del mundo 
que demuestran claramente el ideal que se 
persigue en todas las naciones civilizadas, para 
que ellas sean convenientes para el trabajo, 
econémicas para el comercio, sanas para la 
vida del hogar y agradables para la vida social. 

Muchos de los cuadros expuestos han venido 
a comprobar que los propodsitos que sustenta 
el Comité de Transformacién de Santiago, no 
son simples quimeras, sino que corresponden 


a las ideas ya aplicadas en los grandes centros 
de cultura. 


La Exposicién no ha servido sélo para ilus- 
trar al publico de Santiago, sino que con- 
tribuira tambien al progreso de numerosas 
ciudades de este pais, por cuanto todos los 
Alcaldes y representantes del mayor nimero 
de comunas de todo Chile concurrieron a ella; 
y estoy seguro que cada uno habra Ilevado a 
su ciudad las ideas de aplicacién mas sencillas

Translation of the Foregoing 
Statement 


During the last fifteen days of September, 
1914, the Government opened to the public in 
the Grand Salon of the Palace of Fine Arts 
in Santiago, under the patronage of the Con- 
gress of Municipal Government, the celebrated 
City Planning Exhibition brought here from 
New York by the American City Bureau. 

A very large number of persons—estimated 
at 15,000—visited the exhibition, an eloquent 
demonstration of the interest its installation 
aroused among the educated element of this 
¢ untry. 

The eminently practical form of the exhi- 
bition, a collection of clearly worked out plans, 
photographs and compilations of statistics, 
has materially advanced the public study in 
each section into which the exhibition is di- 
vided. 

The addresses and explanations given by 
Mr. John E. Lathrop, who brought the exhi- 
bition here, and the catalogue which was dis- 
tributed free, have enabled the visitors to find 
the defects of our capital city, and learn from 
the practices of other cities how best to cor- 
rect the defects. 

All the engineers, as well as the magistrates, 
the property owners, the architects, the artists, 
etc., have been given a broad field of ideas to 
bring to us the good results of the study of 
buildings in all cities, their means of com- 
munication with the outside world, sanitation 
and pure water supplies, their centers of 
recreation, education and culture, the location 
and regulation of industrial institutions, ett. 

Every one of the sections of the exhibition 
contained matter which related to the im- 
provement of the different cities of the world, 
composed of photographs and plans which set 
forth clearly the ideals attained by all civilized 
nations in city building, for the convenience of 
work, economy of commerce, better and more 
agreeable living for the people. 

Many of the panels of the exhibition set 
forth the proper method which should be fol- 
lowed by the Committee for the Transforma- 
tion of Santiago, consistent with the needs of 
a great center of culture. 

The exhibition has served not only to illus- 
trate to the public of Santiago the science of 
city planning, but will contribute matcrially 
to the progress of numerous cities of this 
country, from the fact that all the mayors and 
other representatives of the communities of 
Chile who visited the exhibition took to their 
home cities ideas the application of which will 
make them vastly better places of residence in 
the future years.

Commissioner General.

Handicaps to Legal Bond Issues 


Unwise Restrictions on the Freedom of Municipal Borrowing—The Power to 
Borrow, not the Power to Pay, Should be Limited—The Wisdom of 
Selling Bonds under Par—Relation of the Municipality, the 
Bond Dealer and the Bond Lawyer 


By Robert R. Reed 


Of Caldwell, Masslich & Reed, New York 


HE bond lawyer seldom sees the po- 
litical side of the municipal office- 
holder. A bond issue is a business 

proposition, and it is a pleasure to testify 
from an experience covering several thou- 
sand municipalities throughout the country 
that the whole aim of the average muni 
cipal official is to further the interests of 
the municipality which he represents. The 
lawyer is in a position to appreciate this 
fact, and also to realize the character of 
the difficulties with which the municipality 
has to contend. He acts for the bond 
houses on some issues, for the municipali- 
ties on others, and gets to know the interest 
of each. 

The most general of all business prin 
ciples affecting a bond issue is that, within 
certain limitations, a municipal bond can- 
not in the interests of the taxpayer be made 
too attractive to the investor. Every 
handicap to a successful sale costs dollars 
and cents in future tax budgets. Too great 
emphasis cannot be laid on the danger of 
unnecessary restrictions, in constitution, 
statute or ordinance, which adversely af- 
fect the selling value of bonds. Legisla- 
tures and constitutional conventions, being 
further removed from the actual transac- 
tion, are much more apt to be guilty of this 
error than the municipal official who has 
to suffer under it. The taxpayer pays for 
it. This fact should be well fixed in the 
mind, with the fact that the borrowing of 
money is a business proposition. Certain 
restrictions are necessary, others are wholly 
unnecessary and opposed to the business 
interests of the borrower. It is safe to say 
that states and their political subdivisions 
have paid millions solely for the luxury of 
imposing unnecessary restrictions on the 
freedom of municipal borrowing. 

Limitations on the power to pay are per- 
haps the most striking and costly instances 
of legislative short-sightedness. They have 
several forms. One is the general tax 
limit, of which the constitutional fifty-cent 


tax limit of Alabama is the extreme 
lew states have such tax limits by general 
law. Many local laws, bond statutes and 
municipal charters have them. In 
cases, notably in Texas, there is a special 
limited tax for the bonds, which may be 
just sufficient on the present assessed valu 


some 


ation to pay them, with no recourse to a 
general tax. A heavy drop in the assessed 
values will in any of these cases affect the 
assurance of the payment of the bonds; its 
possibility inevitably affects their selling 
value. No municipality ever issues a bond 
which it does not expect to pay in full ac- 


cording to its terms. In ninety-nine cases 


out of a hundred it does pay in full. But 
in the cases which I| have instanced the 
complete legal assurance of this fact is 


lacking, and the municipality pays in the 
end from one to ten per cent more out of the 
limited tax than it would have had to pay 
if this legal assurance had been given, 1. é., 
if there were no tax limit. The courts will, 
of course, enforce the levy of taxes neces- 
sary to pay the bonds, but not beyond the 
limits, if any, in force when the bonds were 
issued. The tax limits in some states and 
low that the 
more conservative bond houses will not bid, 


on some bond issues are so 


and the more conservative bond lawyer will 
not issue an approving opinion that does 
not call attention to the tax limit. The 
bonds are sold on an interest basis substan- 
tially what they would command 
without the arbitrary tax limits. The bonds 
are paid, and the only real sufferer is the 
taxpayer who pays in interest what his law- 
makers have lacked in foresight. There 
should be no tax limits against the payment 
of municipal obligations, certainly not 
against bonds which have to be sold 
ject to the tax limits. 

The same 


above 


sub- 


considerations apply to so 
called assessment bonds, payable out of an 
assessment fund, though a different ques- 
tion is involved. That question is the 
pledge of the general credit to secure an 


[11] 





12 THE 


obligation primarily charged on a special 
fund. If the municipality has secured itself 
in the actual raising of the special assess- 
ments, it would seem to be good business 
to lend the general credit to reduce the 
special burden. In other words, the bonds 
should be authorized as general obligations. 
The bonds must be paid out of taxable 
property in the municipality, and whatever 
is saved is saved to municipal taxpayers. 
The general pledge saves the special tax- 
payer a large amount of money, and with 
rare exceptions costs the general taxpayer 
nothing. There may be special arguments 
to the contrary in some cases. There is no 
argument, however, to justify the expensive 
fallacy of a tax limit in meeting a general 
obligation. The municipality will, of course, 
pay; that is the assumption of the legislator 
and of the taxpayer. How unwise it is to 
make it pay twice, so to speak, by adding a 
substantial fraction to the interest rate upon 
which it borrows! That fraction runs into 
the thousands on many bond issues; for it is 
necessary to bear in mind on this and other 
questions that on a bond of thirty years 
the total interest exceeds the principal in 
dollars and cents, and is payable at an aver- 
age of fifteen years instead of thirty. On 
a twenty-year bond the interest, speaking 
generally, exceeds the principal in present 
money value. 


Limit the Power to Borrow Rather Than 
the Power to Pay 


The limitations upon the tax rate do not 
check municipal extravagance, except 
where they become prohibitive—i. e., where 
no one will buy the bonds at any price. 
Their tendency is rather by limiting cur- 
rent revenue to encourage borrowing to 
meet expenses which should be met in cash, 
to put on a succeeding generation the bur- 
den of to-day’s extravagance. There is 
little need of tax limit for any purpose; 
where it is desired it should be made not 
to apply to the payment of bonds. The 
taxpayer of to-day will provide his own 
tax limit, so to speak. 

It is the fatal mortgaging of the future 
that needs to be checked by appropriate 
legislation. The tax limit does not really 
check this; it only increases the cost of 
the benefit received. The right and neces- 
sary limitation is that upon the bonding 
power itself, that is, a limit of the amount 


AMERICAN 





City 


of bonds that may be issued, limits such as 
we find in most of the states based upon a 
certain percentage of the assessed valua- 
tion of the real estate or fixed taxable 
property of the municipality. This is a 
real limitation; when it exists, there should 
be no tax limit on the power to pay bonds 
issued within the debt limit. In Ohio there 
is a separate small limitation of the amount 
that may be borrowed in any one year, a 
desirable thing in general, but apt to prove 
objectionable in a severe emergency. 

An effective indirect limitation on muni- 
cipal extravagance is to require all bond 
issues to mature serially, commencing with- 
in two years after their issuance, so that 
the burden is felt at once and cannot be en- 
tirely saddled on posterity. Another im- 
portant protection against improvidence is 
the requirement that all bonds mature 
within the “probable life” of the improve- 
ment for which they are issued. The New 
York so-called “home-rule act” of 1913 re- 
quires the city comptroller to determine 
and certify this “probable life.” It would 
be more logical and practicable to re- 
quire the governing body to decide and 
declare this fact in authorizing the bonds. 
It must be borne in mind, however, that 
some “improvements’ —a park, for instance, 
or other real estate—has no “probable life” 
in the sense intended—something the 
draftsmen of the New York act overlooked. 
There should be a limit of time within 
which the bonds must be paid, and the tax 
to pay them should be annual and manda- 
tory. Thirty, or possibly forty, years would 
seem to be a long enough period to liqui- 
date any municipal expenditure. The fund- 
ing of maintenance charges and the succes- 
sive refunding of bonds may be mentioned 
as two evils which are being gradually 
diminished. 


Why Bonds Should Sell a Trifle under Par 


One more very important business fact 
has to do with the connected matters of 
premium and interest rates. As has al- 
ready been stated, a sale of bonds is sub- 
stantially a borrowing of money, and its 
success is to be determined by the net in- 
terest basis on which the bonds are sold. 
The sale of bonds at a premium reads well 
to the public eye. The sale of bonds below 





par reads ill—in fact, it is frequently pro- 
hibited by bonding statutes. 


The intelli- 











THE 


gent municipal official, however, knows that 
it is the met interest basis that counts, and 
the fact is slowly beginning to be appre- 
ciated that, other things being equal, this 
net interest basis, as well as the nominal 
interest rate, is highest when the bonds are 
sold at a premium; it is lowest when the 
bonds can be sold a trifle under par. Most 
large government issues are sold under par 
at low interest rates. There is a very sim- 
ple and self-evident reason for this. Thi 
investor likes to buy at par. The demand 
is greatest and the market is best for bonds 
that can be retailed at par. The invest- 
ment dealer counts his profit within, say, 
two per cent on the best securities—he fre- 
quently takes less or a loss—and up to 
five per cent on issues that have to be 
retailed in a distant market through other 
dealers. The best bond for the municipal 
taxpayer, therefore, is one that can be sold 
at a discount of two to five per cent. The 
best statutory provision that could be made 
for the municipal taxpayer would be one 
requiring bids on the interest rate and per- 
mitting a sale at a discount of two to five 
per cent below par, the discount allowed 
being lowest in those states whose bonds 
are marketed in the home territory. Such 
a law should require the sale of bonds “to 
the person offering to buy them bearing the 
lowest rate of interest, stated in multiples 
of one-quarter of one per cent, at a price 
not less than 95 per cent of the par value.” 


Selling Bonds to Dealer or Investor 


The reference to the dealer’s profit sug- 
gests another matter that has been some- 
what discussed of late, the sale of bonds 
direct to the investor, Nothing is more de- 
sirable to the municipality if, and when, it 
can be done economically. A bond issue ap- 
proved as to legality in advance of the sale 
is in every respect marketable and ready for 
the investor. Millions of bonds are offered 
in this way every year. The investors, large 
and small, frequently bid for them, but in 
nine cases out of ten the investment dealer 
gets them because his bid is the highest 
The answer is simple. The best market is 
the widest market, which only the invest- 
ment houses can reach through the distri- 
bution of the securities. Jt cannot be 
reached in any other way, certainly in any 
cheaper way for the municipality. Each 
investment dealer has his own market, his

not so where circular proofs are furnished 
on demand to all applicants a reasonable 
time in advance of the sale. But in all 
such cases there remains a large element 
of uncertainty, and a possibility that the 
successful bidder cannot obtain a legal 
opinion on which he can market the bonds. 
This possibility is not infrequently realized. 
The legal opinion cannot be obtained, either 
because of a clear illegality in the proceed- 
ings, or because of a question of serious 
doubt which makes it unsafe to approve 
the bonds unless the question is submitted 
to and settled by the courts. 

What shall be done? The dealer has put 
up a deposit to secure his unconditional 
bid. If the bonds are legal, the lawyer's 
doubt does not make them illegal, and the 
check may be forfeited. The lawyer can- 
not, like a court, settle the question; nor 
should he, in the face of a serious ques- 
tion affecting the payment of the bonds, 
solve that question in favor of validity and 
issue an unqualified approving opinion. A 
possible adverse decision in the future 
might invalidate the bonds in the hands of 
the investor, who in the last analysis is the 
real client of the bond lawyer, the one who 
relies upon his opinion in acquiring and 
holding the bonds. The prayer or demand 
of the dealer will not change the lawyer’s 
decision. The dealer seeks the opinion be- 
cause he needs it to sell the bonds; without 
it he has no use for them; he is a dealer or 
distributor, not an investor. His only fault 
has been the making of an unconditional 
bid, a fault to which he was invited by the 
municipality. 

Let it be said to the credit of American 
fair dealing that in nine such cases out of 
ten the deposited check is returned, gen- 
erally, of course, because the defect is 
clearly pointed out and recognized, but in 
many cases, even where the matter is dis- 
puted by the municipality, the check is re- 
turned because good faith and fair dealing 
require its return, because the municipal 
official is intelligent and fair, and because 
the good name of the municipality among 
the bond houses is of much importance. It 
is, however, difficult at times to make the 
municipality understand that the reputable 
bond lawyer, though retained by the bond 
house, is an independent factor in the situ- 
ation, whose opinion is never purposely 
withheld simply to enable a client to avoid a 


contract, and never given where it should be 
withheld simply to enable his client to save 
a deposit from forfeiture. The trouble is 
generally over when this is made clear to 
the municipality, or when it tries to sell the 
honds elsewhere and finds that other dealers 
have the same difficulty in getting an opin- 
ion, or are unwilling to buy because they 
find there is to be a suit on the check in- 
volving the validity of the proposed bonds. 
lhe check is returned, as it should have 
been, and generally is, in the first instance. 


The Bond Lawyer's Chief Function 


A word as to the bond lawyer's attitude 
in approving or rejecting bonds. He repre- 
sents the investor, even though his client 
is the municipality or the bond house. He 
is not a court. He cannot adjudicate and 
settle a serious question affecting the valid- 
ity of the bonds. The investor wishes not 
a discussion of the pros and cons, but an 
unqualified, approving opinion. This opin- 
ion means to him three things: (1) that 
there is power to issue the bonds, (2) that 
this power has been properly exercised, and 
(3) that there is power to enforce their 
payment. If there is a serious doubt as to 
any of these things, the lawyer cannot issue 
an approving opinion; in the language of 
the usual bid, “the legality of the bonds” 
is not “established to the satisfaction” of 
the purchaser’s counsel. Without discredit 
to municipal officials, it may be said that 
there are few bond proceedings which 
do not show some irregularities. It may 
be some assurance to them, however, to 
reflect that as bond houses make their profit 
out of bonds that are approved, not out of 
those which are rejected, a bond lawyer 
whose opinion is refused on idle technicali- 
ties would have no clients; in other words, 
he does not exist. The same fate, strange 
to say, awaits the bond lawyer who is too 
liberal in approving bonds; his opinions are 
thrown back, with the bonds, on the hands 
of the bond house. The municipal official 
will realize what all this means; that a law- 
yer of repute in the municipal bond world 
owes it to himself absolutely and always to 
steer an even, judicial course in giving or 
withholding his opinion; if he did otherwise 
in any instance, his own client would be 
the first to recognize that his opinion had 
lost its value. 





























GRANITE BLOCK PAVING IN DURAT SQUARE, LAWRENCE 


Laying Smooth-Surfaced Granite Block Paving 
in Lawrence 
By Daniel V. O’Connell 


Secretary to the Mayor, Lawrence, Mass. 


HY the people of Lawrence, Mass., 
WW demand granite block paving on 
their streets forms an interesting 

story. 

welve years ago Paul Hannagan, now 
Acting Mayor and Director of the Depart- 
ment of Engineering under the commission 
form of government, constructed a street 
of 8-inch granite blocks set on a sand base 
and grouted with cement. To-day that 
street is apparently as good as new, though 
it is traveled most extensively by heavy 
trucks from the adjoining mills. Not a cent 
has been expended repairing it. 

At that time Mr. Hanagan was superin- 
tendent of streets under the old-fashioned 
two-chamber form of government. Follow- 
ing his election as director of engineering 
under the new charter, there was an insist- 
ent demand for more of his permanent type 
of smooth, dustless, wear-proof paving, 
especially on the principal streets and on 
the streets and avenues traversed by trolley 


lines. A campaign of permanent paving 
was adopted and the money borrowed by 
10-year bond issues. The street railway 
company was induced to join in the cam- 
paign, and in several cases paid for the 
paving between the rails 

In 1912 and 1913 the work progressed 
right merrily, but the greatest progress was 
made in 1914. Early in the year Mr. Han- 
nagan asked the City Council to allow him 
$300,000 for permanent granite block street 
paving. He outlined the streets that were 
to be reconstructed. They were mostly the 
approaches to the city from all directions 
and the heavily traveled commercial streets. 
His paving schedule was adopted with a 
few minor changes, and he was at once 
allowed $250,000 for the work. 

Estimates were requested of all New 
England granite dealers on 1,000,000 Bos- 
ton blocks 3% to 4% inches in width, 10 to 
13 inches (and to average 11% inches) in 
length, and to average from 7% to 8 inches 


[15] 

















16 THE 
deep. The city reserved the right to reject 
all blocks less than 7 inches deep and those 
with protuberances or bunches that made 
them unsightly. It was specified that all 
blocks be straight and sharp, forming right 
angles at all intersections. In order that 
the questionable and troublesome method 
of counting the blocks at the quarry and in 
Lawrence might be dispensed with, ¢he con- 
tract called for the delivery of blocks at an 
average of 24 to the square yard of paving, 
the .measurements of the City Engineer to 
be final. The price paid was $1.64 per 
square yard as laid, with the privilege of 
buying in quantities up to 3,000,000. A 
bond of $3,000 was filed by the successful 
bidder, the Hildreth Granite Company, of 
Boston. 

The streets to be paved were then exca- 
vated. The public service and municipal 
water works departments in the meantime 
had repaired or relaid their conduits, wires, 
pipes, etc., in the street, bringing the ser- 
vices to the side-lines to obviate as much 
as possible the necessity of breaking up the 
paving. The manholes, catch basins and 
poles were all reset, and when completed 
the street, as excavated, was thoroughly 
rolled with a 16-ton roller. 

In the meantime bids had been solicited 
for hauling the paving blocks from the rail- 
road sidings to the job, and awarded at the 
flat rate of 9 cents a square yard, no matter 
how long or how short the haul from the 
tracks to the job. 

When the excavation had been properly 
and sufficiently rolled, there was a base of 
2 or 3 inches of coarse sand laid. The pav- 
ers were then given the grades and lines by 
the City Engineer, and they laid the blocks. 
Only skilled pavers were employed and the 
highest union wages were paid; even the 
laborers received no less than $2.25 per day, 
and many of the more skilled grouters re- 
ceived as high as $3 a day for eight hours’ 
work. 


How the Grouting is Applied 
When the blocks have been laid, a sprink- 
ling of pea gravel is swept into the joints 
in the paving to steady the blocks during 


the process of ramming. After the blocks 
are carefully rammed, the specially con- 
structed steel grout boxes, invented by Mr. 
Hannagan, are brought forward and filled 
with an even mixture of one part cement 


AMERICAN CITY 


and one part sand and mixed with clear 
water to the consistency of thick cream. 
rhe gate in the grout box is then opened 
and the grouting is allowed to flow evenly 
over the blocks, filling the joints and cover- 
ing the whole surface. The grouters watch 
this process carefully and make sure that 
each joint is filled and the surface evenly 
covered. At the proper time, depending a 
great deal on the weather conditions, and 
before the initial set of the cement on top 
of the blocks, the cement is removed by a 
squegee, trowel or hoe, and thrown back in 
the grout box to be used again, preventing 
any waste whatsoever. The whole surface 
is then carefully gone over by a grouter, 
working with a “skimming” or kalsomine 
brush by hand, and smoothing the rougher 
places with his brush, dipped in clear water. 

The operation of removing the cement 
and smoothing with the skimming brush is 
not generally followed by granite block 
pavers, but in the opinion of Engineer 
Hannagan is instrumental in preventing 
dust. He contends, and very rightly, that 
if a quarter, or half-inch of cement grout- 
ing is left on top of the paving it will take 
a year or more for the heavy teams and 
horses’ hoofs to wear it down, and this con- 
stant abrasion is the chief cause of the dug 
that so many people object to. The Law- 
rence streets are never dusty, the surface 
cement having been removed to a minimum. 

The next step is to keep the paving wet. 
When the cement hardens—and this de- 
pends on the weather conditions, or the cli- 
mate in the part of the country where the 
work is being done—the paving should be 
thoroughly wet down with a garden hose if 
possible, or by hand every day for about a 
week. All this time, and from eight to 
twelve days after the work is completed, 
the street should be kept closed to travel. 
One team going over the paving before it 
sets sufficiently may permanently injure the 
whole job. To prevent this the expedient 
has been adopted in Lawrence of placing 
old railroad ties, cord wood, etc., over the 
whole job to keep out autoists and team- 
sters. 

Over ten miles of these streets have been 
constructed in Lawrence at an average cost 
of $3 a yard. This is, in Mr. Hannagan’s 
opinion, very reasonable when one consid- 
ers that there is no outlay whatsoever for 
repairs for twenty or thirty years. There

CLUB’S HEALTH EXHIBIT 


of Chicago 


“Playing Up” a City’s Most Valuable Asset 


By Edward L. Burchard 


Director, Public Health Exhibition, Chicago City Club 


HEN Professor F. O. Jordan, of the 
W University of Chicago, the Chair- 
man of the Club’s Committee on 
Public Health, drew up Public health pro- 
tection is more important than the protec- 
tion of any other kind cf property as the 
theme on which to build up our entire public 
health exhibition, the idea seemed to us 
both new and attractive. The exhibition 
opened on December 1, and will be on dis- 
play in the rooms of the Chicago City Club 
until January 16. 

As Henry M. Hyde, in his article in the 
Sunday Tribune, interestingly interpreted 
this slogan to Chicagoans: 

“What's the use, in other words, of increas- 
ing the police force if you don’t do something 
to stop B. Typhosus and his fellow criminals 
from stealing your health?” 

This basic idea that “Public Health is the 
Community’s Most Valuable Asset,” played 
up in colors on a design imitating the star 
or badge of the sanitary police force, has 
been used therefore as a sort of trade mark 
on the walls of each of the seven sub-com- 
mittee exhibits. 


Sub-Committee Themes 
Each sub-committee has added, to this 
device theme on which the whole exhibit 
hangs, its own special application of it. 
Let us read the Master Signs of these com- 
mittees : 
“Infant welfare is the first investment ; many 


infant deaths and crippling illnesses can be pre- 
vented.” 


[18] 


“Tuberculosis is the most burdensome lia- 
bility; the tuberculosis death rate is decreasing 
and can be further materially reduced in Chi- 
cago.” . . . 

“School inspection is the advance guard, by 
the early detection and treatment of defects 
and deficiencies conserving the coming citizen.” 

“Food inspection guards everybody every 
day from infection, dirty food and harmful 
adulterants.” 

“Patent medicines are usually fraudulent, al- 
ways expensive, frequently dangerous.” 

“Good environment brings good health; the 
public gets only as good an environment as it 
demands.” 

From all this it will be seen that, unlike 
many health exhibits (aptly called “disease 
exhibits”), not personal hygiene but public 
safeguards for health have here been given 
the seat of honor. Indeed, the whole ex- 
hibit pivots around the Chicago Department 
of Health, which, under the personal super- 
vision of Dr. George B. Young, the Com- 
missioner, has made a comprehensive and 
lively exhibit of the many arms of its ser- 
vice. The larger part of the Council’s ap- 
propriation to the department of $2,000 
for exhibits has gone into the preparation 
of this display, as it is the Commissioner’s 
intention to utilize it later for traveling 
exhibits to Chicago public schools. 


Not Simply a Budget Exhibit 
This exhibit was not undertaken simply 
to swell the Department of Health budget, 
however, although a larger force is needed 
in certain branches and more provision for 
the educational work; nor simply to give 











cate Nga

it more of the authority that the New York 
department possesses, but which, as Dr. 
Jordan points out, is denied Chicago by the 
narrowness of the Illinois law. To some 
extent it is, of course, a budget exhibit, 
and the public will doubtless again register 
its faith in its Health Department as it has 
done ever since the department occupied 
in 1894 one office room in the City Hall with 
an appropriation of $50,000. This year its 
staff of 1,000 fill offices by the score and dis 
burse $2,000,000, of which $1,000,000 is 
for current maintenance. 

An impartial civic body like a City Club 
has, at the same time, another duty to per 
form to the public in such an exhibit. It 
should give data enough about the magni- 
tude of each of the city’s health problems 
so that the voter can more or less form 
his own judgment on what his agents in 
the health offices are ceping with and the 
reasonableness of their programs. If, as 
the New York health exhibit states, “Public 
health is purchasable,” the voter

hibit have tried to give.

Talking to Mr. Voter 

To make the voter realize his 
share in the responsibility for 
the city’s health is a principal 
purpose of such an exhibit. An 
ingenious cabinet personally pre- 
pared by Secretary Yeomans, of 
the committee, invites the visitor 
to take a lesson in this subject. 
Unsuspectingly stepping into the 
booth, a curtain automatically 
lifts from before a mirror, and 
below it the surprised observer 
reads the sign, “Portrait of the 
individual who controls Chi- 
cago’s health.” The victim 
smiles, but the thought seems to 
strike in. 

The amount and variety of co- 
operation that a civic undertak- 
ing like this secures is surpris- 
ing. Financial subscriptions for 
the exhibit were secured chiefly 
by the President of the Club,

eon round-table discussions, each committee 
meeting weekly for about three months (al- 
though preparations began in July). This, 
of course, meant one, often two and some- 
times three, committee meetings each day at 
the City Club during this period. 

The experience of the Chicago City Club, 
which has had four large exhibits since it 
opened its new building a few years ago, 
demonstrates the value of a centrally lo- 
cated civic building for exhibition purposes. 
The architect, Mr. I. K. Pond, has had the 
walls of the three upper floors covered with 
a composition board, painted, that. permits 
quick installation. He has even considered 
it feasible, if the building is ever enlarged, 
to add a special exhibition hall on the top 
floor. Such a room would have good over- 
head light and could te used for many 
other purposes as well. 


Some of the Exhibits 

In the present exhibition, wall material, 
panels, designs, cartoons, signs, photo- 
graphs, maps, etc.—some of which, espe- 
cially those by the tuberculosis group, are 
exceptionally attractive--make up perhaps 
two-thirds of the exhibits. This type was 
essential because dining tables fill much of 
the floor space. Wide corridors and special 
rooms make it possible, however, to use 
many features of a three-dimension type. 
Such, for example, are the infant welfare 
equipment, the Lying-In Hospital’s repro- 
duction of a room in the slum to show the 
“before and after” of preparing for the 
baby. Also a full-sized ideal school clinic 
room, the egg candling and microscopic 
demonstrations, and the !lluminating Engi- 
neering Society's series of working models 
showing good and bad lighting as factors 
in public health. The Chicago Ventilation 
Commission’s models illustrate lessons of 
ventilation. Last, but by no means least, 
should be mentioned the room full of me- 


chanical models, stereomotorgraph, etc., put 
in by the Health Department. Here is the 
complete theatre with a melodrama in full 
swing showing the cost to society when 
father contracts tuberculosis from an un- 
ventilated theatre or workshop, the fly 
hatchery and the trail of the fly tracked in 
“cultures,” etc., and many other interesting 
illustrations of the Health Department’s 
work. The department’s exhibit fills one 
entire floor. 

The State Board of Health, also, is in- 
stalling the traveling exhibit of mechani- 
cal models, designed by Dr. C. St. Clair 
Drake, its Secretary, that have recently 
been shown at Freeport, Waukegan, Gales- 
burg and Springfield, and that are to go 
to other Illinois cities. They are described 
in the current number of the American 
Food Journal. 


Attendance and .Altractions 

rhe attendance at the exhibit is gratify- 
ing and is growing. The club members, 
2,300 in number, have the exclusive privi- 
leges during the morning and noon hours. 
In the afternoon there are many men vis- 
itors and groups of women. High school 
classes are beginning to come down in num- 
bers. School nurses in uniform, laboratory 
assistants and others act as demonstrators 
at stated hours. 

The evening and noon series of confer- 
ences arranged by Mr. Chas. Yeomans, Sec- 
retary of the Committee, drew good houses, 
and the programs were evidently interest- 
ing. Several speakers came from out- 
side the city, notably Dr. C. L. Alsberg, Dr. 
Wiley’s successor as Chief of the U. S. Bu- 
reau of Chemistry; Prof. C. E. A. Winslow, 
the ventilation expert of the New York 
State Board of Health; and Dr. J. W. 
Schereschewsky, of the U. S. Health Ser- 
vice, Director of the International Hygiene 
Exhibit held at Washington a few years 
ago. 

At the close of the first two weeks of 
formal conferences a series of motion film 
entertainments is to be given, one each 
week to the end of the exhibit. These and 


the special nights for diferent nationalities 
and other groups promise to keep the peo- 
ple coming from all parts of the city. Later 
it is hoped to use the exhibits at some outer 
assembly points, but these plans for neigh- 
borhood use have not been perfected. 








THE AMERICAN CITY 


“By-Products” 


One of the most valuable “by-products” 
of the exhibit has been the informal bring- 
ing together around the same board of city, 
state and federal officials and of 
private health agencies Here they have 
discussed common problems from the view- 
point of the city as a whole. This tends 
to develop a better sense of proportion as 
to their own part in public health work and 
as to all other collaborating factors and 


leaders 


agencies concerned in it. 

For any city it would seem worth while 
to take a cross-section by this exhibit 
method every now and then, if only to get 
the proper focus on the work now in prog- 
and to find out what the next steps 
should be. It takes a yroup mind and col

Chamber of .Commerce reorganized 
November 1, 1913, one of the planks in- 
serted in our platform was the indorsement 
of a vocational night school and the use of 
our school buildings for 
Harmonious relations were established 
with our Board of Education, and Prof H. 
H. Baish, superintendent of our public 
schools, was made a member of our Edu-

a result of this joint action, the night school 
was established shortly after the reorganiza- 
tion of the Chamber, with an attendance of 
65 the first night. At the close of the year 
the attendance was 950. The second year 
opened with an attendance of 300, which 
has grown until the enrollment is now past

usual experiences of 
according to data gathered by the State 
Educational Department, which shows that 
in most cities the attendance starts with a 
maximum on the first night, and then de 
creases very rapidly. 

That Altoona should have such a large 
attendance, and the courses of study be so 
wide and efficient, is due partly to the fact 
that Altoona is very liberal in appropria- 
tions for school equipment, as well as sal- 
aries, and a high standard is demanded of 
its instructors. Another reason is that Al- 
toona is the heart of the Pennsylvania Rail- 
road system, which has 16,000 employes at

THE AMERICAN 


Great interest is taken in the four classes 
devoted to American citizenship. There are 
200 foreigners in these classes. The pre- 
ponderance of nationalities ranges as fol- 
lows: Italians, Germans, Russians, Poles, 
Danes, Spanish, Greeks, Hungarians, Irish 
and Swiss. There are three classes for 
men and one for womeu. There are 170 
men and 30 women in these classes; nearly 
all when they entered were unable to speak 
English, and interpreters were needed. 
The most marked progress has been made 
by these students. 

Once a week these foreigners entertain 
the whole night school for one hour with a 
song-fest. Each group sings its respective 
folk songs, and a period is devoted to teach- 
ing all the groups American patriotic songs. 
It is an inspiring sight when the whole 
school is gathered together in the huge 
auditorium and joins in “America” or “The 
Star Spangled Banner.” During the win- 
ter an entertainment, “The Songs of All 
Nations,” is to be given in which all the 
groups will participate. 

Dr. Millard B. King, vocational educa- 
tional expert of the State Department of 
Public Education, who has inspected the 
vocational night school a number of times, 
has pronounced it not only the largest and 
most effective in Pennsylvania, but one that 
can hardly be equaled in any city of the 
country. Under the State Vocational Act, 
night schools that successfully pass inspec- 
tion are granted an appropriation whereby 
two-thirds of the cost of instruction is de- 
frayed by the state. Needless to say, the 
Altoona school has passed muster and re- 
ceives its appropriation. 


City 23 


The courses of study in both night and 
day schools are elective, students in the for- 
mer being given even greater latitude than 
the latter. A system of credits is being 
arranged so that pupils who graduate from 
the High School with grades above a fixed 
mark can enter the Pennsylvania shops as 
apprentices and receive higher wages than 
apprentices who have not proven so pro- 
ficient in school work. 

In the promotion of efficiency the Educa- 
tional Committee of the Chamber of Com- 
merce made a survey to learn in what boys 
and girls are deficient when they leave 
school—the fundamentals, reading, writing, 
orthography and arithmetic, initiative, ap- 
plication, industry and thrift. A question- 
naire covering these poisits was directed to 
more than 100 employers of labor in the Al- 
toona industrial zone. The replies were 
analyzed and without publication turned 
over to the public school authorities, prov- 
ing valuable aids in making instruction 
more practical as judged from the needs of 
employers of skilled labor. This survey is 
being enlarged to cover every phase of ac- 
tivity of the public schools. 

A feature of home credits introduced last 
year is proving a valuable aid. This pro- 
vides that the monthly report card of each 
pupil’s standing shall carry a record to be 
filled out by the parents, indicating how 
well the pupil has attended to home duties 
or employment outside of school. In the 
fourteen school districts of the city, patrons’ 
meetings are a monthly and semi-monthly 
feature. Talks on efficiency, civic develop- 
ment and town boosting by Chamber of 
Commerce speakers are features. 





The Menace of Street Trading by Children 


By Helen C. Dwight 


National Child Labor Committee 


IVIC cleanliness does not consist solely 

C in clearing streets of refuse; it con- 

sists, too, in clearing streets of people 

who will either harm the streets or be 
harmed by them. 

Detroit is a good example of a city that 
is putting this theory into practice. She 
has now under consideration an ordinance 
forbidding street trading by boys under 12 
and girls under 16, requiring boys between 


12 and 16 to secure badges signifying their 
fitness to work, and prohibiting street trad- 
ing after eight at night or before five in the 
morning by boys under 16—an ordinance 
which is the result of a long series of events 
that have taught Detroit that civic welfare 
demands the regulation of work on the 
streets by children. 

As long ago as 1877, Detroit made an at- 
tempt to control the moral hazards of street 











24 THE AMERICAN CITY 


trading by requiring all newsboys to secure 
badges from the license collector with the 
approval of the mayor, who was empowered 
to revoke a badge for the use of profane 
language or the committing of “any act of 
a disorderly or dishonest nature.” As the 
city grew, this ordinance became less and 
less effective until, with the usual number 
of badges issued in a year between 2,000 
and 2,800, it was obviously impossible for 
the mayor to supervise the morals of the 
boys in any way. It was impossible, too, to 
be sure that every newsboy had a badge. 
Once or twice a year the police were or- 
dered to round up the boys without badges 
and send them to the Juvenile Detention 
Home to get their permits. Otherwise there 
was no systematic attempt to give out the 
badges, and an investigator stated not long 
ago that in a group of 75 newsboys he found 
only one with a badge. 

Little by little the newsboys began to fall 
into disrepute. Judge Hulbert, of the Juve- 
nile Court, stated this year that 50 per cent 
of the boys brought to court were news- 
boys. The Police Commissioner thought it 
wise to rule that no boy under 10 might re- 
ceive a badge, but this regulation could not 
be enforced under the existing system of 
granting badges. 

Finally conditions among newsboys be- 
came so bad that the boys themselves went 
on a strike, appealed to the Detroit Federa- 
tion of Labor for help and formed a union. 
Their first grievance was that they could not 
return unsold papers; but when this was 
adjusted by an agreement with the news- 
papers, they turned their attention to other 
conditions of street trading. It was known 
that many of the smaller boys made street 
work a means of begging, picking pockets 
and getting money by any means they could, 
and that many of them stayed out so late 
at night that they fell asleep in school or 
were dull in their lessons in consequence. 
So, by way of bettering conditions, the 
Newsboys’ Union resolved that boys under 
16 should be kept off the streets after 9 
P.M. They asked the police and the news- 
papers to help enforce this ruling, but re- 
ceived no encouragement whatever and 
finally organized a “free-lance squad” to 
enforce it themselves. It took perseverance 
and not a little fighting, but in one night 
they cleared the streets of most of the 
younger boys. About this time a special 


agent of the National Child Labor Commit- 
tee, who was investigating street trading in 
Detroit, began to work with the Newsboys’ 
Union for a new ordinance. The ordinance, 
now before the City Council, was endorsed 
by the Newsboys’ Union, has the support of 
many citizens, the Y. M. C. A., the Federa- 
tion of Labor and the Juvenile Court, and 
should do a great deal to better conditions. 

The agent of the National Child Labor 
Committee has reported that “so great is 
the problem that it is difficult to know how 
to go about measuring it.” He has found 
begging, gambling, panhandling, delin- 
quency and lack of education enough among 
the street traders of Detroit to disprove 
once for all the idea that the boy who sells 
papers to-day is on the straight road to the 
White House, and he states that the condi- 
tions he has found “ought to stir every 
person with a determination to wipe out the 
whole business of child-exploitation in 
street occupations.” 

But Detroit is no worse than most other 
cities, and her problems no more serious 
than theirs. The National Child Labor 
Committee finds juvenile court officials, so- 
cial workers and school authorities every- 
where ready to testify that street trading, 
unregulated as it is in most cities, is a posi-* 
tive menace to civic improvement. It is not 
enough to form Newsboys’ Clubs and 
Homes in the hope of lessening the moral 
contamination of the boys. The evil cannot 
be mitigated; it must be stopped. If the 
streets are breeding delinquency and ignor- 
ance in our children, why not keep the 
children from too early and too intimate 
acquaintance with them? Why not clear 
the streets of small children? That is the 
question the National Child Labor Com- 
mittee is asking the cities. 

This year the Committee’s chief interest 
is naturally the Palmer-Owen federal child 
labor law, now before Congress, and on 
Child Labor Sunday, January 24, a special 
plea for this bill will be made. But the 
Committee is not forgetting the street child 
and the problem of the cities in relation to 
that child. Street trading is a thing no fed- 
eral law can touch; the states must regu- 
late it for themselves. And so, in the ma- 
jority of the fifteen states in which the 
National Child Labor Committee is carry- 
ing on legislative campaigns, street trades 
laws are being urged.

New Electric Light and Power Rates 
Houston, Texas 
By Paul H. Sheldon 


Secretary, Civil Service Commission, City of Houston 


OR years the Houston Lighting & “going value.” 


Power Company, without competi- 

tion, has been showing net earnings 
of about 20 per cent on estimated yearly 
valuations. The total dividends of the 
company on its capital stock from 1906 to 
1914, were $1,553,125, and the net value of 
the properties of the company for the last 
year was appraised by experts, employed 
by the city of Houston, at only $1,524,841. 
The service was fair to the consumer, but 
the rate were admitted to be high. 

In February, 1914, Mayor Ben Campbell, 
of the city of Houston (which is operated 
under the commission form of government), 
inaugurated the first step of an investiga- 
tion into the affairs of the Houston Light- 
ing & Power Company. The avowed pur- 
pose was either to bring about a substan- 
tial and equitable reduction in the price of 
electric light and power, or the building of 
a municipal lighting plant for Houston. 

The city, in order to arrive at an equit- 
able basis for making the new rates, em- 
ployed Mr. Lamar Lyndon, consulting en- 
gineer, of New York City, and Mr. Henry 
E. Elrod, of Dallas, Texas, to make a 
minute investigation of the physical and 
book properties of the company, together 
with their operating costs, earnings and 
disbursements, general output and equip- 
ment. The city’s experts, after three 
months’ time, submitted a comprehensive 
report showing the financial history of the 
Houston Lighting & Power Company, ics 
earnings and disbursements, rates charged, 
output, etc. They placed a valuation of 
$1,524,841 on the properties of the company 
ifter allowing for depreciation, and recom- 
mended that the new rates be made to al- 
low 8 per cent returns on that investment. 

The Mayor and Council furnished the 
lighting company a copy of the report and 
gave that corporation 90 days within which 
to have an inventory and appraisement 
made by their own experts. The company’s 
experts found the value of the plant and 
properties to be $2,753,584, upon which they 
claimed they were entitled to returns. How- 
ever, they made no allowance for deprecia- 
tion, but did make a full allowance for 


The difference between the 
valuation placed on the company’s proper- 
ties by the city’s experts and the company’s 
experts was $1,228,743. The Mayor de- 
cided that the “real value” lay somewhere 
between the city’s and the company’s ex 
perts’ valuations. 

\fter all reports were received, the City 
Council with the Mayor studied each care- 
fully and then gave the city experts and 
the company’s representatives a hearing, at 
which each presented their respective 
After hearing all the facts, the 
Mayor and Council fixed the new rates to 
permit the company to earn $160,000 net 
each year, in excess of all costs of opera- 
tion, maintenance and taxes, and after al- 
lowing a fair amount to be set aside for 
depreciation. This $160,000 represents 8

consequently the company has already re- 
turned approximately $155,000 in cash re- 
funds to Houston citizens on bills for light 
and power paid since April 15, 1914. 
Under the adjustment agreed upon, the 
Mayor of Houston was given power to 
name two members of the Board of Direc- 
tors of the Houston Lighting & Power 


Company. These members will own no 
stock, but will represent the city’s interests 
on the directorate. The settlement also 


gave the city the right to participate equally 
in all earnings of the company in excess of 
$160,000, or 8 per cent per year, while still 
retaining the right to reduce the light rates 
from time to time in the future, so that the 
earnings will not exceed & per cent on the 


amount fairly invested in the enterprise. 

Houston has absolute right to regulate 
the rates, service, etc., of the public service 
utilities operating in this city. This right 
is a charter provision, backed up by the 
Constitution of the State of Texas, which 
gives Texas cities home rule. The charter 
provision is carried out by municipal ordi- 
nances passed by the City Council. This 
right is also included as a provision in all 
franchises issued by the city to public util- 
ity companies. At the present time Texas 
has no state public utility commissicn or 
other body to which appeal might be made 
in the event that a public utility desired 
such action. Plans are now on foot for the 
establishment of such a state commission. 





Capitalizing Street Improvement Indebtedness 
in Tucson 


By George H. Smalley 


Secretary, Pima County Taxpayers’ Association, Tucson, Arizona 


HE paving of streets began in Tucson 

in 1914 under the Arizona state im- 

provement act, which provides that 

serial coupon bonds bearing 6 per cent in- 

terest shall be issued against all property 

holders benefited by paving whe fail to 

make payments in cash when their pro rata 

of the expense is made known to them. 

These bonds mature yearly for a period of 
ten years. 

With the paving era there came a new 
scheme of municipal finance, which, so far 
as I know, has never been employed in any 
city in this country. The first application 
of the plan has been made towards the re- 
demption of $165,000 of water works im 
provement bonds. These are thirty-year 
bonds bearing 5 per cent interest. The in- 
terest is paid by direct levy, but instead of 
making an additional levy sufficient to pro- 
vide a fund whose thirty-year accumula- 
tion would redeem these bonds, the earn- 
ing power of investments and reinvestments 
in street improvement bonds covering thirty 
years of such activity was ascertained, and 
the people taxed with the difference. 

Only those familiar with the possibilities 
of compound interest earnings under such 
investment conditions can realize that $165,- 


000 of bonds can be redeemed in thirty 
years by raising but $62,618.58 from the 
taxpayers. All that is required is activity 
in investing and reinvesting the sinking 
fund and its interest accumulations, and 
this can be done easily so long as street im- 
provement work continues. It is not likely 
that a progressive city like Tucson will 
allow a year to pass without doing a few 
thousand dollars’ worth of such work, es- 
pecially when judged by the first year’s 
progress, amounting to about $150,000. 
The amount of bonds which shall be re- 
served to the city by the paving company 
equals the amount that the city proposes to 
raise each year as a sinking fund, which is 
but $2,087.286. This amount, together with 
the interest earnings, becomes the city’s 
yearly investment in street improvement 
bonds bearing 6 per cent interest. 

At the end of the first year the sinking 
fund will have $2,212.523 to its credit, being 
the amount raised by taxation and the inter- 
est earnings through the investment in 
street bonds. This, with the second year’s 
levy of $2,087.286, will be invested in the 
same class of local bonds, and at the end of 
the second year the sinking fund will have 
$4,557.798 to its credit. And so on down 








THE AMERICAN CITY 


through the years, each year the city re- 
serving enough street improvement bonds 
to consume the amount of the sinking fund 
of that year. The earnings at compound 
interest increase greatly in later years when 
the accumulation of levy annuity and com- 
pound interest earnings represent a large 
sum, as will be seen by the following table 

(First year’s levy, $2,087.286, and the

Taxpayers to-day re- 
ceive the benefit as well as future taxpay

upon a solid basis which will be of lasting 
credit. 

This plan was taken up by newspapers as 
a news story and recently the New York 
Bond Buyer commented upon it as an 
unique departure in municipal finance. 
Street improvement bonds, owing to the 
short term of years they run, bear a high 
rate of interest, Any city can take advan

Civic Activities in England in War Time 


lo the Editor of Tue American City: 

From letters which I have received from 
friends in different parts of America, great 
interest seems to be taken in the conditions 
of affairs in England during the present 
crisis. friends who are connected 
with civic and social institutions are par- 
ticularly anxious to know how the admin- 
istration of our towns and cities is being 
continued and what has happened to the 
numerous propagandist bodies which exist. 

To take the Garden and 
Planning Association of Great Britain as 
an index of the activities of propagandist 
societies in general, it will answer the ques- 
tion if I say that our list of subscriptions 
ending at the close of this year will prob- 
ably be higher than any year in our exist- 
ence, and that while there is a slacking off 
of work in some directions, there is a great 
increase in others. 

New societies are being formed in several 
parts of the country for the purpose of 
promoting garden suburb and garden vil- 
lage schemes such as we advocate, and now 
that the Government has agreed to lend 
money up to 90 per cent of the value of the 
property, including 10 per cent as a free 
grant, we may hope for enormously in- 
creased activity in all our busy centers. 
The provision of this money will operate in 
the steadying of unemployment and also 
in the solving of many difficult housing 
problems. 

The other European countries where so- 
cieties are in affiliation with us are not so 
favorably situated. I have received re- 
ports from several of them which indicate 
that most of their members are now en- 
gaged in relief work of various sorts, and 
their committees are bending their ener- 
gies to Red Cross work and the provision 
of comforts. 

It is in that regard, perhaps, that we find 
the greatest difference from our normal 
lives. Nearly all of us who take interest in 
public affairs are serving on several com- 
mittees, either for the alleviation of distress 
or the succoring of refugee Belgians. Of 
distress and unemployment the ordinary 
man sees nothing. I myself have not come 
into touch with a single case of financial 
distress caused by the war, and in the town 
in which I live, of 80,000 inhabitants, there

does not appear to be any unusual unem- 
ployment. 

If there is any difference whatever in our 
municipal administration, it is the absence 
of party recriminations at the council meet- 
Both in Parliament and Council 
House the voice of party is hushed, and 
the only desire seems to be to get to grips 
with the subject matter in hand and solve 
it for the well-being of the community. 
Contested elections seem to be things of the 
past, and many a member of many a council 
who has incurred the displeasure of his 
constituents will have an uncontested return 
because of the desire for non-controversial 
action. 

If you walk through our streets in the 
centers or the suburbs, or visit the parks 
and open spaces, or look over our schools 
or museums or art galleries, there is no 
sign of lessened activity. 

Far from abandoning their works, local 
authorities are being encouraged to push on 
with them. Many new schemes for hous- 
ing, baths, town halls, etc., are being set on 
foot, and the whole country is acting up to 
the motto we see displayed everywhere— 
“Business as usual.” Some trades provid- 
ing luxuries only may have been hard hit, 
but on the whole trade is normal, and has 
been so since the first fortnight of alarm. 

The lines of drilling recruits pacing our 
streets to the three airs which seem to have 
been adopted as our marching songs—‘The 
Marseillaise,” the Russian national anthem 
and “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary”’—show 
the enthusiasm which has spread through 
the country. All the vacant spaces which 
can be spared, the quiet squares and out-of- 
the-way gardens, are being employed for 
this purpose. 

We are face to face with a 
world tragedy—a tragedy that every now 
and then comes home with the news of the 
death of another friend. But the nation is 
taking it wonderfully calmly, and we are 
all convinced that the only possible ending 
to this war is the absolute crushing of those 
conditions of things which made it possible.

A Mechanical Sewage Treatment Plant for 
Daytona, Fla. 


AYTONA is a Southern Atlantic 
coast winter resort city in Florida, 
on the Halifax River, Volusia 

County. The permanent population is 
6,000, with a winter population of about 
10,000, 

In the design and construction of clari- 
fication apparatus for Daytona, the engi- 
neers were confronted with the following 
conditions, and the Riensch-Wurl 
was selected for meeting the conditions in 
the most economical and sanitary manner 


screen 


1. Ample dilution water in the Halifax 
River, thus not requiring the removal of all the 
organic matter 

2. Local topography and arrangement of 
city, suggesting a combination of pumping 
station built practically in the middle of the 
city with accompanying screen 

3. Conditions of the soil, quicksand uni- 
formly under the surface a few feet, making 
tanks of any depth or size very expensive 

4. Local topography, permitting ready and 
inexpensive means of disposing of fresh 
screenings by burying them 

5. Convenience of operation afforded, in 
that a screening and pumping plant could be 
attended to in a single location while settling 
tanks would probably require attention in a 
place separate from the pumping station 


The work covers the construction of a 
complete sanitary sewerage system, includ- 
ing sewage pumping station, outfall line,

he sewage pumping station comprises a 
concrete receiving well with a brick super 
structure located on the city water works 
lot on Magnolia Avenue. In this station 
there will be placed two 50-h.-p. oil engines; 
two air compressors, each having a capacity 
of 150 cu. ft. of air per :ninute; three cen

in the Halifax River about 500 ft. from 
shore. 

lhe drainage system will comprise about 
7,500 ft. of pipe sewers, ranging in siz 
from 1!2-in. vitrified pipe to 30-in. rein 
forced concrete, storm water inlets and the 
widening of the North acd South Canals 

Of the station equipment, the interesting 
feature is the clarification and disinfectior 


of fresh raw sewage by the combination of 
a Riensch-Wurl sewage screen and auto- 
matic chlorine disinfecting apparatus. The 
effluent from this combi::ation is discharged 
without further treatment of any kind 

Sewage enters the disposal station 
through a 24-in. vitrified sewer and first 
passes through a fixed screen having bars 
3% by 2 in. on 2%-in. centers. The bat 
screen is 3 ft. 6 in. wide, affording an effec 
tive open area through the screen with a 
maximum sewer capacity of approximately 
150 per cent of the area of the sewer. 

rhe bar screen is cleaned manually. The 
screenings are collected in special cans 
with perforated bottom to allow them to 
drain into the influent channel. From the 
bar iscreen the sewage flows on to the 
Riensch-Wurl screen, 8 ft. in diameter, 
placed on an inclination of Io degrees in 
the sewage. The total area of the 8&-ft. 
screen is 43 sq. ft., and under maximum 
flow conditions and submerged effective 
area is 30 sq. ft., which is about 70 per cent 
of the total screen area. 

The screening plates are made of '-in. 
monel metal, arranged in sections on the 
screen frame. The screening plate perfora- 
tions are 5/64-in. wide by 2 in. long, stag- 
gered. With the above effective area and 
size of slots, the present capacity of the 
screen will be about 1,900,000 gallons per 
day, ultimate capacity of about 2,000,000 
gallons per day. 

rhe specifications require: 

1. That “the screen must remove from thx 
sewage all solids, sedimentable and non-sedi- 
mentable, above ten-hundredths of one inch 
diameter, and must deliver these screenings to 
the transporting or containing device with a 
minimum moisture content, accomplishing these 
results through no disintegration of the 
sewage. 

2. “All bearings and driving mechanism 
must be supported from the service bridge 
No bearings or any part of the driving 
mechanism must come into contact with the 
sewage. 


The first requirement was met by provid- 


ing the size slots as above mentioned and 
sufficient submerged screening area to give 
ihe required capacity. 

lhe second was obtained by furnishing 
the overhung type of Riensch-Wurl screen 
here illustrated. 

lhe arrangement of Vie screen as shown 
varies from German practice, inasmuch as 
no bearings or wearing parts are in the 
sewage 

lhe Riensch-Wurl screen will be driven 
from a countershaft in the station by oil 
engines, two being installed, to furnish 
power for the entire system, including the 
ejectors, one at each end of the counter- 
shaft, to provide against emergency. The 
screen will require about '4 h.-p. for oper- 
ating the disc and the cleaning mechanism. 

rhe effluent from the screen is sterilized 
by chlorine gas. The chlorinator is of such 
size that it is capable of feeding chlorine 
gas at any desired uniform rate between 
the limits of 10 Ibs. and 150 lbs. in twenty- 
four hours. The system is equipped with 
reducing and regulation control valves, to- 
gether with gages and all other necessary 
appurtenances, and is piped to allow sterili- 
zation, both of raw sewage entering the 
pumping station and of clarified sewage 
after passing the Riensch-Wurl screerf. 
From the Riensch-Wurl screen the effluent 
flows into the pump well, from which point 
it is pumped through the outfall into the 
Halifax River. The advantages of this 
arrangement of pumps and screens are 
obvious: 

1. The screens protect the pumps. 

2. With the pumps after the screens the 
solids are not disintegrated and the maximum 
cleaning effect is obtained. 

3. The pumps provide thorough mixing of 
the disinfection agent and the effluent. 

The screenings from the Riensch-Wurl 
screen are discharged into cans, which are 
handled by a small wall hoist and disposed 
of by burial. 

The plans and specifications for the work 
were prepared by George W. Fuller, Con- 
sulting Hydraulic Engineer and Sanitary 
Expert, New York City. The Engineer-in- 
Charge of Construction is C. M. Rogers, 
I-ngineer for Board of Tublic Works, Day- 
tona. The apparatus for fine screening and 
disinfection is being furnished and installed 
by the Sanitation Corporation, New York

The Engineer’s Function in Municipal 
Development* 


By Morris Llewellyn Cooke 


Director, Department of Public Works, Philadelphia, Pa. 


HI role which the engineer is to play 
in the development of our munici- 
palities will depend primarily upon 

the attitude taken by the profession as a 
whole toward what appears to be a wonder- 
ful present opportunity, and also upon the 
ability with which the work of the engineer 
is brought to the attention of the public 
There is no real reason why municipal en- 
gineering should not be made to comprise 
most municipal undertakings. 

The test by which the role of the engi- 
neer is to be determined will be the devel 
opment in our profession of a genuine 
spirit of public service. The community is 
apparently ready to accord the engineer a 
leading, perhaps a controlling, part, if the 
engineer will consider that in every decision 
and act there shall be the clearest possible 
recognition of the public interest. 


Engineering has now reached the stage 
of development where it has become a pro- 
fession in the highest sense of the word. 
The engineer being a scientist, his respon 
sibility should be for the development of 
facts, regardless of whose advantage they 
may serve. I have in mind that the service 
of an engineer should be as the service of 
a judge and as opposed to the service of a 
lawyer who confessedly seeks out and rep- 
resents the interests of his client, and often 
“makes the worse appear the better cause.” 
Chis is justified by the fact that lawyers 
are not scientists, and by the assumption 
that there shall always be opposing counsel. 

In the medical profession during the last 
generation, largely owing to the enlightened 
leadership of the American Medical Asso- 
ciation, there has been inaugurated a great 
forward movement with the slogan of “pre- 
ventive medicine.” The medical profession 
in a way seemed to launch a campaign to 
wipe out its opportunity for a livelihood. 
There were, and I suppose still are, doc- 
tors who held that in advocating “preven- 


* From a paper presented at the annual meeting of 
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New 
York, December, 1914. Mr. Cooke’s paper was fol- 
lowed by a lively discussion, from which two excerpts 
are also given. 


tive medicine” the profession was standing 
in its own light. The profession, however 
is held in higher esteem than ever before 
Under the new conditions there is a broader 
field for the activity of practitioners, both 
medical and surgical, than had ever before 
been available. 

On the contrary, in inviting the attention 
of our profession to the municipal field, we 
are apparently opening the door of oppor 
tunity to tens of millions of dollars’ worth 
of work which is not now either considered 
engineering nor carried on by engineers 
Che municipal field is almost virgin soil so 
far aS engineering is concerned. As re 
cently as ten years ago the problem of snow 
removal, for example, was so absolutely in 
the hands of thumb rule, and in many in 
stances even of inexperienced men, that it 
is probably true that in no city in this coun 
try was it being attacked either by engi- 
neering methods or by engineers. Yet it 
will not be denied that on work of this 
kind, in which one city spent nearly $3,000,- 
000 in six weeks last year, there is in reality 
an engineering problem of considerable 
magnitude. 


Many municipal engineers in this coun 
try are beginning to adopt the European 
system of employing non-residents for cer 
tain highly specialized positions. When 
ever this is practiced it excites criticism 
and abuse. As yet no technical organiza- 
tion, so far as | know, has recognized th« 
opening thus made for technical merit and 
given moral support to the movement 


Especially in engineering work, almost 
the entire absence of what may be called a 
financial program is the great handicap 
Private institutions can go along for years 
on a straight operating basis and without 
the necessity for undertaking any extensive 
construction work. But a growing city- 
and all our cities are growing cities—must 
necessarily have to spend a considerable 
part of its income on construction. This 
can he done with intelligence only by taking

a long look ahead For instance, at the 
present time in Philadelphia we are facing 
expenditures of from $20,000,000 to $25, 
000,000 on a sewage disposal installation ; 
perhaps $40,000,000 for rapid transit; with 
extensive additions to our water supply sys 
tem, not to mention other millions which 
could profitably be spent on sewers, bridges, 
grade crossing removals and a much needed 
program of modern highway construction 
There is probably no city in the country 
that is even attacking this obvious business 
problem in an intelligent or energetic Wa) 
Reform will not be brought about until the 
community, and especially the business part 
of the community, is educated as to its 
necessity 

1 am not one of those who feel that all 
our shortcomings are “the fault of the peo 
ple.” I would rather assume my share of 
the responsibility for conditions as they ar¢ 
and then join with my professional asso 
ciates and the community at large in better 
ing them. If we engineers are to have any 
prominent part in this, there are funda 
mental changes which we shall have to 
make in our own equipment for the work 
In the first place, we have to get rid of the 
now old-fashioned idea that advertising is a 
crime. | admit that as a part of my work 
as a public official | put in a great deal of 
thought on what may be quite properly 
called advertising. By that I mean that | 
pay less attention in my reports to dignity 
of form and diction than to making them 
sufficiently interesting to be read. It is 
only as we engineers who are public officials 
learn to make the public, sometimes against 
its will, understand our work, that we are 
to get that degree of popular support for it 
which will make it possible for it to be done 
in an efficient manner. 

In my Opinion it is going to become mort 
and more a necessity, not only in public, 
but in private work, for engineers to be 
able to popularize what they are doing. It 
is true to-day that a man who wants to do 
really good and efficient work can do s 
only after an aroused public opinion. You 


cannot drive people in a democracy. So 
I admit that in offering employment to an 
engineer, other things being equal, I want 
what might be called a good advertiser. 
You can secure appropriations for work 
more easily when it is well advertised. The 
Panama Canal is a good example of this 





CAR Cites 


principle \gain, advertising is the best 
possible check against ill-advised expendi- 
tures. If the public knows how a street is 
supposed to be constructed or cleaned, you 
do not require as Many paid inspectors on 
the job. 

The development of some varieties of 
municipal engineering is absolutely depen 
dent upon the dey elopment of public opinion 
and must proceed with it. The matter ot 
street cleaning is largely a question of an 
improved public taste in the matter of 
street paving. Unless streets are well 
paved they cannot be well cleaned, except 

a prohibitive cost. To jump from one 
degree of cleanliness in this respect to 
another, without a supporting public opin- 
ion, may be enough to wreck an adminis- 
tration and to set the tide of civic improve- 
ment running in the opposite direction. 

lhe newspaper is the great educator in 
these matters to-day. But we are already 
using in Philadelphia moving pictures, pa- 
rades and exhibitions. The possibilities of 
these and other means of publicity are not 
vet fully understood 


\gain, more effort must be put into hu- 
manizing public administration. The en- 
gineer shares with those who have had the 
opportunity for education the mistaken 
idea that the man at the top is in a position 
to tell the man at the bottom what is good 
for him. The fact that our country was 
founded and has been perpetuated on the 
contrary idea has not seemed to affect the 
situation very much. 

lake, for instance, the movement which 
has led to the formation of large numbers 
of business men’s associations and improve 
ment associations. This affords one of the 
very best examples of the present vitality 
of American public life. Our leading men 
should accept them as something that has 
come to stay and codperate with them in 
such a way as to direct their activities into 
profitable channels. It seems to me they 
afford the most promising agency through 
which in the first place the thought of the 
public on civic questions can be crystal 
lized, and, secondly, through which that 
thought can be given expression in definite 
public procedure. I have found these as- 
sociations ready and anxious to hear from 
men who had definite knowledge on matters 
of public interest. It should be the atti-

place the difficulty in having engineers with 
the public point of view has not been e1

and, therefore, men who have entered th

Our American cities have only recentl) 
come to a realizing sense of the importance 
of accurate and expert service from engi 
neers. The old theory was that a man who 
devoted half of his time to engineering and 
half of his time to politics was a_ better 


public servant, or at least more entitled to 


the job. As a consequence of this, the pub 
lic have regarded their engineers as politi 
cal place men and have not been willing to 
sanction the payment of salaries at all in 
proportion to those paid by private em 
plovers. 

Before we can expect the engineers as 
professional body to change their attitud 
therefore, we must have on the part of th 
people a perfectly frank understanding that

Development of a Town Civic Center 


N its evolution from a typical new Eng 
land rural community to a high-class 
residential suburb, Winchester, Mass., 

has given special attention to the further 
development of its already beautiful civic 
center. An important forward step was 
the recent letting of contracts for diverting 
the channel of the Aberjona River to the 
middle of the civic center area Chis work 
which is now under way, will involve an 
expenditure—for the dam and core wall, 
moving the channel, and building two new 
concrete bridges, to widen the main thor 
oughfare—of over $28,000. Plans have also 
been accepted and contracts awarded for 
the new fire and police building shown in 
the accompanying sketch 

In 1911 the Waterways Improvement 

Committee of the town of Winchester re 
tained Mr. Herbert J. Kellaway, landscape 
architect, of Boston, to devise means of im- 
proving the sanitary conditions and appear 
ance of the Aberjona River. In his report 
Mr. Kellaway outlined the possibilities of 
improving the Mystic Valley throughout 
the entire course of the Aberjona River 
through the town of Winchester. The pro 
posed improvements in the neighborhood of 
Main street and the railroad station af 


[40] 


forded exceptional opportunities for devel 
oping the town’s civic center, and the ac 
companying plan was subsequently evowed 

Some years ago this town spent $90,000 
acquiring a mill property close to Main 
Street and the Mystic Valley Parkway 
which passes close to the new center. This 
appropriation also covered a considerable 
area of land along the banks of the Aber 
jona at this point. The old riparian rights 
connected with the stream were recently 
acquired by the town. The Park Commis 
sioners are debating on the question of 
dredging the mill pond for which the new 
dam is now under way as part of the devel 
opment. It is expected that bids will soon 
ve requested for doing this work,‘ although 
it will come outside of the original appro 


priation 

It is hoped to complete the work by 
spring. The bridges carrying Main Street 
and Waterfield Road over the stream ar 
both under way and the foundations for the 
new dam are in. 

When the river has been turned into its 
new location the banks on each side will be 
shaped up and trees and shrubbery planted 
in accordance with Mr. Kellaway’s plans 
\ promenade will be constructed along the

A Photographic Service 

Soutn Benp, Inv.—Photographs of im- 
portant buildings, street and _ industrial 
scenes, and of prominent men and women 
in South Bend have been recently taken 
through the codperation of the photog 
raphers of the city with the South Bend 
Chamber of Commerce. The photographers 
were supplied with cards upon which to 
record the subject, date, negative number, 
the photographer’s name and address, and 
other information of value. This record 
is maintained in the office of the Chamber 
of Commerce. 

The fact that such photographs and in- 
formation are on file with the South Bend 
chamber and that the Chamber is in a posi- 
tion to place editors in touch with the lat- 
est photographs of leading men, was com 
municated to a selected list of daily papers 
and trade journals over the country, and 
it is said that many calls for the service 
are received.

For Industrial Efficiency 


CotumBus, Onio.—The Industrial Bu- 
reau of the Columbus Chamber of Com- 
merce has organized an “efficiency squad,” 
the members of which place themselves at 
the service of the local industries desiring 
expert advice upon factory costs and in 
securing operating efficiency. The squad 
pays flying visits to establishments, each 
expert devoting himself to one department 
of the industry and all reporting their 
views to the owner or manager at the end 
of an afternoon’s visit. 

The squad is composed of a competent 
operating manager of a large concern, an 
accountant of reputation, an efficiency en 
gineer, and a banker, the latter to be se 
lected by the manufacturer desiring the 
services of the squad. The operating man- 
ager observes the men at their work and 
takes note of the lay of the machines; the 
accountant devotes his time to the manner 
of handling the books and the system 
used; the efficiency expert inspects the 
progress of the work in the factory and 
notes whether it is carried through in the 
most efficient manner; and the banker con- 
fers with the president of the company in 
regard to the requirements of banks and 
how best to get financial assistance in times 
of need. 

An example is given of the case of a 
small manufacturer who was selling his 
product at about 20 per cent below cost. 
Although he appeared to have many orders 
for his goods, his business was netting him 
no profit, and he had asked the Chamber of 
Commerce to procure a loan for him which 
his bank had refused. The squad went 
through the manufacturer’s establishment 
in two hours, and made recommendations 
which enabled him for the first time to do 
business at a profit. He found that he 








THE AMERICAN 


could market his product at a higher price, 
and that he therefore did not need the 
money for which he had asked. 

It is said that the time of these investi- 
gators would ordinarily be worth $200 or 
$300 per day collectively, but their services 
are given free of charge in the interest of 
Columbus industrially. 

It is the aim of the Industrial Bureau to 
produce the greatest possible efficiency in 
the local industries, and to enable them to 
become such good money-makers that the 
people of Columbus will regard investment 
therein as most desirable.

A New Research Bureau 


Akron, Oun10.—With the ultimate object 
of launching a campaign for a new charter 
for Akron, the Akron Chamber of Com 
set out to raise a fund of $12,000 
for the establishment of a municipal re- 
search bureau which would make a thor- 
ough study of existing conditions in Akron 
and secure the necessary data for carrying 
on a campaign of education prior to the 
forming of a charter commission. It is 
reported that the. money has been sub- 
scribed and that the Bureau is an assured 
institution. 

It is thought that the research Bureau 
will be of great value also to the Chamber 
by way of assisting in the collection of sta- 
tistics required by the different committees 
in their work and in securing facts for fur 
ther constructive work in behalf of the best 
interests of the city. 

The director of the new Bureau, it is said. 
will have entire management of the organi- 
zation, which will be conducted indepen- 
dently of the Chamber, but with its cooper- 
ation.

Industrial Education 


WiiiaMsport, Pa.—With the expecta- 
tion of establishing in Williamsport an in- 
dustrial school linked up with an actual 
factory somewhat after the pattern of the 
Independent Industrial School at Beverly, 
Mass., Mr. Charles C. Krouse, president of 
the Williamsport Board of Trade, recently 
made a study of the Beverly plan. 

The school at Beverly, which is conducted 
as an adjunct of the United Shoe Machin- 
ery Company, was established with a view

to giving the boys an education directly in 
line with objective employment and to qual 
ifying them as workmen in a thoroughly 
practical manner. The results of this train 
ing have been more than satisfactory to the 
promoters of the idea; while the effects in a 
psychological way upon the students are a 
real pleasure in their work because of their 
ability to do it well and because of their 
increased earning capacity, a consequent 
brighter outlook upon life, and a keener in 
terest in human affairs 

The report of Mr. Krouse, which de 
scribes the plan in some detail, is embodied 
in a booklet entitled, “Report of an Investi 
gation of the Independent Industrial School 
at Beverly, Mass.,”’ and obtained

A Continuation School 

Boston, Mass.—Boys and girls in Boston 
under sixteen years of age who are engaged 
in gainful occupation are now required to 
spend four hours of every week in the Bos 
ton Continuation School, and the employers 
of the young people are obliged so to ar 
range their duties that they may absent 
themselves for this purpose lhe legisla 
tion establishing continuation schools and 
classes in the Commonwealth of Massachu 
setts received the hearty support of the 
Boston Chamber of Commerce. Non-com 
pliance with the law on the part of an em 


ployer is punishable by a fine of not less 
than $10 or more than $100, and failure to 
attend classes on the part of any minor to 
whom the act applies is punishable by the 
revocation of his or her school or employ 
ment certificate. 

lhe convenience of the employer and the 
welfare of the individual are considered in 
arranging the hours for attendance at 
classes. The required four hours per week 
may be devoted to study all in one day, or 
divided into two two-hour periods, or four 
one-hour periods a week. In some instances 
classes will be conducted at the place of 
employment. 

Continuation instruction will be of two 
general types: (a) occupational courses, 
bearing directly on trades, manufacturing 
and business, with classes in such subjects 
as salesmanship, shoe and leather work, 
practical arithmetic and shop work; (b) 
cultural courses, designed to widen the in- 
tellectual horizon, with courses on civics, 
commercial geography, history, etc. In 
both groups studies will be related to the 
pupil’s vocation, or will help him to find

Recent Publications 


N a recent volume entitled “Trade Mor 
als; Their Origin, Growth and Prov- 
ince,’ Mr. Edward D. Page contributes 

to our rather scant library of business phi- 
losophy a most valuable and enjoyable 
study. The theme is the evolution of high 
standards in business. Mr. Page, who is a 
director of the Merchants’ Association of 
New York, and who for nearly forty years 
was actively engaged in business, speaks 
from the sane viewpoint of a practical man 
He places much emphasis upon the increas 
interdependence of business and_ social 
groups, and shows the great need for co- 
operation among all groups for their own 
ultimate interests, as well as for the good 
of society. Specific subjects, such as un- 
fair competition, graft, disparagement, and 
local price-cutting, are taken up, with a dis 
cussion of the moral and economic qualities 
involved. The chapters describing business 
conditions, immigration and its effect upon 
trade customs in America, quick trading, 
competition and contract, are particularly 


on Trade Subjects 


interesting. Mr. Page's carefully grounded 
conclusion is that, “other things being 
equal, men of principle are increasingly 
better fitted to survive in the bitter com- 
petition by which the economic world is 
ruled.” 

In contrast to Mr. Page’s broad and un- 
prejudiced attitude is that adopted by Al- 
gernon Sidney Crapsey in “The Rise of the 
Working Classes.” This book appeals 
frankly to class consciousness rather than 
to any general social consciousness which 
would codrdinate the interests of various 
groups. All capitalists are assumed by the 
author to be engaged in sacrificing higher 
principles to the idea that “business is busi- 
ness,’ while the rest of the world, consist- 


ing of downtrodden working people, must 
either remain antagonistic to the capitalist 
class or dominate it. The redemption of 
society depends upon its conforming to the 
ideals of the working class. The author's

Cloth Window Ventilation for Public Schools 
By John B. Todd, M.D. 


Syracuse, N. Y. 


NEW method of ventilating school 

buildings has been developed in 

Syracuse, N. Y., that makes every 
school room an open air room, and at the 
same time preserves a temperature of com 
fort and eliminates cold drafts. 

This result is obtained by means of closely 
fitting wood frames, covered with heavy, 
finely woven, unbleached cotton cloth 
These are placed in the window frame out- 
side of the lower sash, which is then raised. 
Each class room requires about one square 
foot of screen per pupil. The cloth screen 
acts as a permeable membrane, allowing the 
outside air to slowly diffuse into the room; 
at the same time it filters the air so that it 
is free from dust. Pupils in these rooms 
do their work more easily and make more 
rapid progress. There is freedom from 
hacking, coughing and headaches. Discip- 
line is much easier to maintain. 

In Sumner School, where this system of 
ventilation was first tried out, it was not 
an uncommon occurrence for a child to 
faint. It is a modern, fan-ventilated school, 


and before the installation of cloth screens, 


was filled with body odors, with restless 
hacking and coughing pupils. I placed fi 
screens in the windows of one roo al 


immediately there was a marked improv 
ent in these conditions. Instead of 
coming easily fatigued, the pupils showed 
increased en¢ rey, did better work, 
cipline was easier to maintain 

Subsequent examinations revealed a sci 
entific basis for the improved conditions 
lhe humidity was found to be practically 
that of the outdoor air The dust 
practically eliminated, except when mud 
was brought into the room by the children’s 
feet. The odors disappeared and the light 
ing of the room was not interfered with 
the screens giving a diffused light that was 
comfortable to the eyes. The temperature 
was more easily maintained at a degree of 
comfort than before. This experiment was 
begun early in 1912-13 and the resulting 
betterments made teachers in other rooms 


eager to have screens and open-air condi 
tions in their rooms, so that finally seven

more rooms were equipped at the expense 
of the teachers. 

The success of these fresh air rooms 
caused an influx of pupils from other 
school districts, and later in the school year 
of 1913-14 the building was completely ven- 
tilated by the cloth window screens, which 
were in use for the last three months of the 
school year. All the class rooms, coat 
rooms and halls were equipped. This makes 
a total of 82 screens in the building, and 
a total area of 720 square feet of opening 

From this time the ventilating fan was 
not used, as the air conditions were so much 
improved throughout the building. The 
Principal states that she never felt so well 
as since her office has been ventilated, and 
the teachers are unanimous in their com- 
mendation of the improved air conditions. 

A consideration of the factors involved in 
cloth window ventilation forces the conclu- 
sion that their use results in an economy 
and an actual conservation of heat. 

Cost of heating and ventilating by the fan: 


a = cost of heating the required amount 
of air 

b = cost of power to deliver the air 

c = cost of maintenance of fan system 

d = cost heat loss from ducts 

e = cost heat loss from glass windows 


The number of heat units required to 
raise the temperature of equal volumes of 
air, equal number of degrees, will be the 
same, whether the air is heated by coils in 
the basement or by radiations in the rooms. 

Cost of heating and ventilating by cloth 

window ventilators: 
a = cost of heating the required amount 


of air 

b = No cost; the fan is not used 

c = no cost 

d = no cost 

€ = practically no cost; the loss of heat 
from the windows is almost 
eliminated 


Single glass panes permit substantial heat 
loss from the warm air, but by substituting 
cloth there is a slow current of air diffusing 
into the room, and little heat is lost by win- 
dow conduction. The heat loss from the 
upper window is minimized by the raised 
lower window, which gives a dead non-con- 
ducting air space between the two sashes. 

Thus the conclusion is inevitable that 
cloth window ventilation results in a great 
economy by eliminating or reducing the fac- 
tors b, c, d and e that swell the expense of 
the fan-ventilated buildings. 

That 720 square feet of cloth screens 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


could be put into a school, fill the building 
with fresh, pure air, and at the same time 
save a very substantial amount of money 
for the city, seems incredible, but is fully 
substantiated by the facts. 

The Syracuse Chamber of Commerce, 
through its committee on education, thor- 
oughly investigated the cloth screen venti- 
lation and reported that for the three 
months in which Sumner School was fully 
ventilated by cloth screens, the cost for elec- 
tricity (an electric motor ran the fan) was 
$152 less than the same period of 1913-14 
and $131 less than same period of 1912-13. 
lhe report showed that there was a further 
saving of 25 tons of coal, although the win- 
ter was much more severe, and stated that 
$500 would be a very conservative estimate 
of the saving for a school year. It was 
found that the screens had been tried out 
in a number of schools, public and private, 
and endorsed by principals, teachers and 
medical inspectors, and the committee rec- 
ommended that the city authorities provide 
money to put them into 2,675 windows of 
the public schools of Syracuse. 

The Goodyear Burlingame, a_ private 
school of Syracuse, used cloth screen ven- 
tilation last winter. Miss Goodyear writes: 

“The screens were so great a success that this 
year they have been placed in all the windows 
of the north side of the two rooms and the west 
side of a third. It has not been necessary this 
year to use any other ventilating system. * * * 
In former years the opening of schools has 
been the signal for the breaking out of colds 
among the children, just returned from the 
country and unaccustomed to confinement. 

“This year there has been thus far only one, 
easily traceable to home conditions, and no 
other illness. There are a few pupils in this 
department who have come from an open-air 
school. They show no signs of suffering from 
the change, and their influence has done much 
to fan an already strong desire among pupils 
and parents for pure air in the school rooms, 
and there has been no opposition. 

“There is a well-developed pride in our lack 
of colds and general physical well being, and 
the fresh-air rooms are popular as well as 
beneficial. On going to other class rooms the 
children are apt to sniff the air and at once ask 
to have the windows opened.” 

The educational value of this simple 
method of ventilation becomes apparent as 
the children absorb the knowledge of the 
value of fresh air living and the simple 
means of obtaining it, and thus it becomes 
incorporated into the lives of the people to 
the betterment of the health of the com- 
munity.

YPSILANTI’S MUNICIPAL GAS PLANT 


A Successful Fight for a Municipal Gas Plant 
By William B. Hatch 


President, The Ypsilanti Press 


N November 2, 1914, the city of Ypsi 

lanti, Mich., purchased the property 

of the Ypsilanti Gas Company and 
undertook the municipal ownership and 
operation of the gas plant. In doing so it 
closed a long and at times bitter struggle 
between the gas company and the city 

Three years ago the gas company, realiz 
ing that its franchise would expire in two 
years more, asked for a renewal of the 
franchise for a period of thirty years. Up 
to this time the relations between the com 
pany and the city had been fairly satisfac 
tory. The city enjoyed a price for gas 
which compared favorably with that of 
neighboring cities; but the request for a 
new franchise immediately started an agita 
tion for municipal ownership. 

The advocates of municipal ownership 
had a strong argument in the fact that Ypsi 
lanti had been one of the early cities to un 
dertake the municipal ownership and opera 
tion of its water and street lighting plant 
This plant had been a pronounced success, 
as it had supplied water at a low price, had 
given excellent service and had been a 
money-making investment for the city 

Within a few months after the discussion 
was started a straw vote was taken to de 
termine the wishes of the people. This re 
sulted in an overwhelming vote for muni 


ipal ownership, the vote being something 
like four to one in favor. Many of the peo 
ple thought that the question was now prac 
tically settled and that the city would soon 
be in possession Later they discovered 
that they had a long road to travel and 
much hard work to do before they could 
own and operate a gas plant 

First of all they found that the banking 
interests and nearly all of the legal talent of 
the city were against them, and that in vari 
ous ways these interests wielded an in 
fluence far out of proportion to their num 
bers. They found, too, that there were | 
gal restrictions placed upon the cities of the 
state which made it very difficult for them 
to acquire and operate any public utility 

In beginning the struggle the people 
elected a council and mayor pledged to mun 
icipal ownership. A special municipal own 
ership committee was appointed in the 
council, and this committee began its work 
hy asking the gas company to name a price 
for which it would sell its property. Repre 
sentatives of the company refused to name 
a price and pointed out that the city in its 
charter had no authority to acquire or op 
erate a gas plant. This was true enough 
and the municipal ownership committee un 
dertook to amend the charter, but were 
stopped by a decision of the Supreme Court 


[49] 











50 THE 


of the state, which refused to allow a city to 
amend its charter unless it had first adopted 
a revised charter under the new state con 
stitution adopted a few years before 


Following this decision of the court, there 
was an agitation in many of the cities of the 
tate for an amendment to the constitution 
which would give the cities authority to 
amend their charters even though they had 
not yet adopted a revised charter. Such an 
amendment was submitted to the voters of 
the state and was carried at the fall elec 
tion in 1912. Following this the legislature 
met and passed a law specifying the man 
ner in which such amendments could be 
made. The city immediately amended its 
charter, giving it the right to own and oper 
ate a gas plant and specifying the manner 
in which it might 
such ownership 


proceed to bring about 
This might be either by 
buying an existing plant or by building a 
new one. 

In the meantime the city had secured Mr 
Alton D. Adams, a public utility engineer, 
to prepare plans and specifications and esti 
mates of cost for the construction of a new 
gas plant. The gas company now offered 
to discuss the terms of a sale and named the 
figure of $227,000 as the price at which they 
held the plant. After a long period of hag 
gling with the committee, they reduced this 
figure to $165,000. Here they stopped and 
refused to go further. 

The council then voted to submit to the 
people the proposition of building a new 
plant at a price of $160,000 in accordance 
with the specifications of the engineer. Just 
before this question was to be submitted to 
the people, the gas company came forward 
and offered to sell for $125,000. This propo- 
sition was accepted by the city, but before 
it could be submitted it was found that the 
city must wait for another decision of the 
Supreme Court, which was trying the new 
law under which the city had amended its 
charter and under which it claimed author 
itv to own a gas plant. Before the court 
was ready with its decision, the proposed 
contract with the gas company had expired 
by limitation. In asking for a renewal of 
the contract the gas company brought in a 
proposition for an additional sum for re- 
pairs and replacements and the mayor 
vetoed the whole proposition. 

Again the council decided to submit the 
proposition of building a new plant, and 
this was voted on at the spring election. 


AMERI( 


AN CITY 

lhe gas company and their allies by strenu 
ous efforts succeeded in defeating this pro 
position, but as it lacked only sixty votes of 
the three-fifths necessary to carry it, the 
council immediately voted to call a special 
election and resubmitted the question to the 
voters. The gas company now offered to 
sell the property for $110,000, and this offer 
was submitted to the voters and ratified. 

Again at this point the city found itself 
facing a serious difficulty in a decision of 
the Supreme Court. In deciding on the 
right of cities to own and operate public 
utilities, a question had been raised as to the 
right of the city to bond itself for such a 
purpose. The court had decided that, ac- 
cording to the statute, while a city could 
issue bonds against the general credit of the 
city to the amount of ten per cent of its 
assessed valuation, only one-fifth of this 
could be used for public utilities, i. e., water, 
gas and electric plants. The cities were, 
however, allowed to issue mortgage bonds 
secured by the property and revenue of the 
plant to he acquired but not by the general 
credit of the city. 

Inasmuch as the city of Ypsilanti had 
outstanding public utility bonds amounting 
to more than two per cent of the assessed 
valuation of the city, it could issue no more 
general credit bonds for public utility pur 
poses, and it was compelled to mortgage the 
plant to the full amount of the purchase 
price. The committee drew a very care 
ful mortgage, pledging the city not to re 
duce the price of gas until the bondholders 
were taken care of and they were able to 
show that with these prices the gas com- 
pany had been making very large profits 
The banks looked with disfavor on the 
bonds, the gas company discouraged their 
sale and the bonding houses offered no en- 
couragement — one of them being frank 
enough to say that they opposed municipal 
ownership because it interfered with the 
hond business that they were doing with the 
privately owned public utilities. To add to 
the discomfiture of the city, the European 
war broke out just as it was to put its bonds 
on the market. 

In spite of this, however, a committee of 
business and professional men of the city 
was organized to push the sale of the bonds, 
and they pushed so effectively that the 
whole issue was subscribed and paid in 
about three weeks’ time. The bonds were 
issued to the amount of $130,000, so as to

pay for the plant and provide a working 
capital. The denominations were $1,000, 
$500 and $100. Subscriptions for the bonds 
ranged in amounts from $100 to $10,000. 
The committee held daily meetings during 
the time that it was carrying on its selling 
campaign. All of the committee served 
without compensation and the entire issue 

$130,000 six per cent bonds was sold 
without the expense of one cent by the city 
for underwriter’s or agent’s commissions. 
The committee had the satisfaction of see- 
ing the bonds oversubscribed by some $2s,- 
000, and on the day set the city was ready

with the money. The plant was put in the 
care of the commissioners of public works, 
who will attempt to show that a city can 
run a gas plant with local capital and that 
after the payment of the bonds they can 
show a profit for the benefit of the city as 
a whole. Advocates of municipal owner- 
ship believe that at the present price for gas 
the city can in ten or twelve years have a 
plant clear of debt which will earn a profit 
of $15,000 a year on ninety-cent gas; where- 
as under private ownership it would pay 
the same price and at the end of twenty or 
thirty years have nothing to show for it. 





Relation of Practical Plumbing to Sanitary 
Sewers and Water Waste* 
By Harry Y. Carson 


Tile House-Sewers Source of Ground Water 
in Sanitary Sewers 

N practice it seldom happens that a house 
| sewer is constructed as carefully as the 
main sanitary sewers in the streets. 
The branches leading into the houses from 
Y fittings in the trunk lines have a total 
length, when taken collectivély, far greater 
than the main lines. These branch lines to 
the house should be, but are not, the most 
carefully constructed parts of the whole 
sewerage system. These main house sew- 
ers, which are continuations of the house 
drainage system, are put in by the plumber 
or owner at “any old gradient” and some-

times without a single cemented joint. In- 
variably the settlement of the soil, which 
is usually loosely packed about the house 
sewers, causes these lines to sag and open 
up still more at the joints. These flefec- 
tive joints allow the ground water and seep- 
age from the buildings to flow into the sew- 
ers along with the household wastes. The 
evil effects of ground water in the sanitary 
sewerage system and the consequent added 
cost to the community are too well known 
for repetition here. A glance at the sewage 
flow chart, the data of which were compiled 
by Edward D. Rich, C. E.,* shows how im- 
portant it is to keep ground water out of the

system. It can be noticed that during the 
wet seasons of the year, when the ground 
water level rises considerably above the 
sewers, there is an enormous increase in the 
quantity of the sewage handled by the sys- 
tem, and this, of course, adds a large extra 
cost to the community as a whole. One 
other effect of this leakage is the possibility 
of soil pollution in the immediate vicinity 
of the sewers, but this is not likely to have 
any serious effect upon the larger problem 
of sewage disposal, although it may affect 
water supplies. Also the roots of lawn trees 
A rem- 
edy of these difficulties can be found by 
compelling the property owners to extend 
the main house drain, which is of iron, to 
the main tile sewer in the street or alley. 
It is also essential to make a thoroughly 
tight joint with the main sewer, and thus 
eliminate the greatest 
water from the sewage disposal system 


Materials Best Suited 


In this connection we might dwell very 
briefly upon the question of materials from

which the drainage pipes and house sewers 
should be constructed. Well-made vitrified 
sewer pipe will undoubtedly last longer than 
any other kind of pipe, but is unsuited to 
withstand stresses. Inasmuch, however, as 
properly made extra heavy weight cast iron 
pipe is known to have lasted much longer 
than the expected life of modern structures, 
it may be relied upon to maintain a thor- 
oughly water-tight sewer line between the 
plumbing fixtures and the sanitary sewer 
Other forms of iron pipe, such as wrought 
steel, are more suited to withstand condi- 
tions where excessive stresses are met in 
practice but have such a short life that pro- 
vision must be made for their 
replacing.

Curtailment of Public Water Waste 


Another point of vital importance is the 
curtailment of our enormous water waste. 
It is common knowledge among water sup- 
ply engineers that an enormous amount of 
public water (sometimes as much as a 
fourth of the total consumption) is wasted 
through bad types of plumbing fixtures. 
Metering individual services does not pre- 
vent the loss, although it makes it possible 
for the water corporation to more accu- 
rately adjust the charges against consumers 


City 

In this respect the matter of good and bad 
types of plumbing fixtures in common us« 
at the present time must be considered. The 
plumbing laws must point out to the public 
which types are bad, but special provision 
must be made to eliminate improper plumb 
ing equipment which may cause an unneces- 
sary waste of water down the sewer. An- 
other source of water waste in cold climates 
is that used in winter to prevent pipes from 
freezing. In poorly heated houses a faucet 
is commonly left running continuously at 
full stream to uncovered

Automobile 


Fire Stations 


By Arthur S. Aungst 


Chief, Fire Department, East Liverpool, Ohio 


HE topic of automobile fire stations is 
very important, as the motorizing of 
fire departments has completely 

changed methods of constructing such 
buildings. 

he one-story, or bungalow, type of fire 
station is preferable in the residential dis 
trict, where ground is available at a reason 
able price—preferable both for convenience 
and for economy in the upkeep of buildings, 
etc. It also eliminates the sliding poles, 
which we know are dangerous to the men; 
many accidents occur from falls through the 
pole hole when the men are only partially 
awake. 


A Station at Alliance, Ohio 

[he automobile fire station, No. 3, built 
at Alliance, Ohio, in 1909, under my super- 
vision, is of the one-story, or bungalow, 
style, with accommodations for one piece of 
motor-driven apparatus—a triple combina- 
tion engine, chemical and hose car. The 
building was constructed at a cost of $4,800, 
exclusive of the land. This is believed to 
be the first automobile fire station built in 
the United States. 

The station, which is semi-fireproof and 
steam-heated, is set back 45 ft. from the 
street, with a concrete runway, slightly ele 
vated to give the apparatus a good start

district of East Liverpool, Ohio, which can 
be built for $5,000, exclusive of the land, 
and which overcomes some of the defects of 
the first building, particularly in the size 
of the rooms.

13-in. foundation walls, and with 9-in 
6-in. partition walls. 
44 ft. 8in. by 4o ft. 8 in. The roof supports 
are of fire-resistant material trimmed with

13 ft. on both sides of the entrance to the 
apparatus room, which is in the center. 
lhe hose tower, in the rear, is over 35 ft. 
high, and runs to the basement, where there 
is a pit for washing the hose. The base- 
ment also contains the boiler room, the coal 
room, the clothes dryer, and provision for 
storage, and has a concrete floor.

ing to the apparatus room and the recrea- 
tion room.

The fire alarm switchboard is 
so situated that it can be operated in the 
lobby or in the apparatus room 

The apparatus room is 17 ft. by 38 ft. 6 
in., and has a 12-ft. ceiling and a concret« 
floor. The rear of the apparatus room can 
be used for washing and repairing ma- 
chines, or for a double company. There is 
a pit of the same size as in the Alliance sta- 
tion, for getting under the machines to re- 
pair them, with sewer connections, and with 
a vent pipe from the apparatus room to 
carry smoke and fumes outside the building. 
There is also a drip pan under the appa- 
ratus, with a pipe to the outside, so that, in 
case a carbureter floods or leaks, the vapor 
will go the outside. The walls are to be 
finished with a wainscoting of yellow glazed 
tile, with white glazed tile to the ceiling. 

The recreation room is 12 by Io ft., with 
doors leading to the apparatus room and the 
captain’s room. It has a fireplace, and is 
finished with a wainscoting of dark glazed 
tile, and light glazed tile to the metal ceil- 
ing. The captain’s room is finished in rough 
plaster and painted in flat tone. The werk 
room, 12 ft. by 8 ft. 6 in., is in the rear of

[In my estimation the first consideration in 
designing and building automobile fire sta- 
tions should be the comfort of the men. 
Neatness and the beautification of buildings

to make the station as homelike as possible

The Storage and Care of Gasoline 

Chere is a danger to be considered in the 
construction of automobile fire stations that 
did not exist in providing for the housing 
of horse-drawn apparatus—the use of gaso- 
line and oil. On account of its volatile na 
ture, gasoline should be stored at all times 
Fluctuation of temperature should be pre- 
vented, and the lowest possible temperature 
maintained in order to avoid evaporation 
lo this end, underground storage of gaso- 
line tanks is generally practiced. It is un- 
wise to depend on any arrangement such as 
gas, water or gravity for getting the fluid 
in time of need; the only satisfactory means 
of procuring gasoline is through a pump 











58 THE AMERICAN CITY 


For safety, all the 
should be at the top 


connections to the tank 

his is highly impor 
tant because of the possibility of the pipe 
connections at the tank becoming loosened 
by the settling of the earth beneath the tank 
or above and beneath the pipe. Should any- 
thing happen to the connections at the top 
of the tank, there would be no leakage, and 
the tank would not be found empty in time 
of need. By having the tank connected by 
one pipe to the pump placed at a point in 
the fire station convenient to the 
driven apparatus, gasoline may be 


motor- 
drawn 


from beneath the ground exterior to the 


building to the interior of the 
above ground. 

When two or three fires occur within a 
short time, it is necessary to run the cars 
back to the station tor additional supplies 
of gasoline, and it is important to be able to 
pump the gasoline quickly from the under- 
ground tank to the car reservoir. Great 
care should be taken that the gasoline does 
not come in contact with the air when it is 
taken from the pump, and that the fluid is 


building, 


pure and clean. This is accomplished by 
equipping the pump + ith a water separator, 
known as the centrifugal filter, through 
which medium water and other foreign mat- 
ter are separated from the gasoline as it is 
pumped from the tank. 

With the aid of a metering device, it is 
possible to determine, at any moment, the 
amount of gasoline taken from the tank 
through the pump for a given period. The 
pump should also be equipped with a special 
locking device, to prevent its operation dur- 
ing a period when the station is left without 
an employe, which is sometimes the case 
during a disastrous fire. 

Statistics show us that practically every 
disaster due to gasoline explosion or fire can 
be traced to ignorance or 
Gasoline is not dangerous when properly 
handled. It is the vapor given off by gaso- 
line which, mixed with air, makes an ex- 
plosive combustion more dangerous than 
dynamite. While oils for motor-driven ap 
paratus are not dangerous, they also should 
be stored in approved tanks. 


carelessness. 





The Burning of 


HE great fire which started late in the 
afternoon of December g in the large 


plant of Thomas A. Edison, Inc., at 
West Orange, N. J., caused much damage 
to the property. There were _ thirty- 


four buildings in the entire establishment; 
of these, three brick buildings were de- 
stroyed and five or six of the new buildings 
constructed of cement were injured by 
cracking. In general, however, it may 
be said that, with comparatively slight ex- 
ceptions, the concrete withstood the fire, and 
it is believed that if the windows of the con- 
crete buildings had had metal frames and 
wire glass, these structures would have been 
shown to be fireproc:. 

The efficient fire drill secured the safety 
of the 6,000 employes of the plant, with the 
exception of a foreman, who is thought to 
have lost his life by returning to one of the 
buildings to rescue some of the girl workers 
who were believed to be still in danger. The 
contents of Mr. Edison’s office, library and 
experimental rooms, most of which could 
not be replaced, were removed to safety, 
and the laboratory and the buildings ad- 
joining it were protected from the advance 





the Edison Plant 


of the fire. Insufficient water supply hin- 
dered the work of the firemen and was the 
cause of much damage. 

Since the examination of all the ma 
chinery of the concrete buildings has been 
completed, the salvage has been found to 
amount to 85 per cent. Much progress has 
been made in cleaning up the wreckage, and 
restoration plans are being made, in accord- 
ance with Mr. Edison’s statement written at 
the height of the disaster and herewith re- 
produced.

-Housing for California’s Immigrants 

The opening of the Panama Canal has 
set the people of the Pacific Coast thinking 
seriously about the problem of the influx 
of immigrants, which is bound to be large 
after the war is over, with the establish- 
ment of several great steamship lines mak- 
San Francisco and Los Angeles their 
first ports of call from Europe. 

The California Immigration and Housing 
Commission is studying the problem of en- 
couraging the building of proper homes for 


4-months water works im-

immigrants,

these and particularly what 

prevent their con 
gestion in tenements and in unsanitary 
such as are menace to 
the community in the North End of Boston 
and the East Side of New York. The 
Commission has sent Charles Henry Che- 


steps 


homes, so severe a 


ney, City Planner, of San Francisco, to 
inspect model workingmen’s _ villages, 
homes, and tenements of the country and 


to collect data for the preparation of an 
exhibit to demonstrate to the people of 
California during the coming spring what 
has already been done in the foremost cities 
and Europe. 
\Vhile in the East last month, 
outlined his mission as follows: 


of \merica 
Mr. Cheney 


“The housing problem in this country is 
being faced by all communities because of its 
serious menace to the health, particularly, and 
also to the comfort and convenience of the gen- 
eral public. California is anxious to exergise 
a little forethought on a problem that has be- 
come so serious in nearly all the larger cities 
We are collecting data as to the work of hous- 
ing associations and official commissions, such 
as the Homestead Commission, which is doing 
such splendid work in Massachusetts. 

“A great deal of the work for housing im- 
provement in this country has been largely leg- 
islative, in the establishment of tenement and 
housing codes, building laws, etc. While the 
proper enforcement of these laws will do much 
to improve slums and tenements, they are after 
all restrictive and palliative only, not providing 
any substitute housing. The crying necessity 
is for preventive and constructive work—the 
careful thinking out of measures and the edu- 
cation of the community to provide, in the 
place of the tenement, substantially built, sim- 
ple, sanitary but attractive homes for people 
of smaller means. 

“The California Immigration and Housing 
Commission hopes to educate the builder and 
the community by showing concrete examples 
of what has already been done successfully with 
a return on the investment, and at the same 
time to strengthen the law to remedy existing 
bad housing conditions. The great point is that 
the Commission is trying to show a way out 
of the housing problem before the influx into 
the state can make things much worse than 
they are. Well-housed immigrants will make 
good citizens. Badly-housed people not only 
develop as poor citizens, but are generally a 
serious menace to public health and safety.”

ARCHITECT'S SKETCH OF NEW MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM, CINCINNATI 


auditorium is being projected in connection 
with the proposed subway plans for the 
utilization of the canal property for an in 
terurban entrance into the city. A subway 
station will be built underneath the build- 
ing, giving it both passenger and freight 
handling facilities. 

On the Plum Street side will be a lecture 
hall, equipped as a complete theatre, inde- 
pendent of the rest of the building and hav- 
ing a seating capacity of 600. Several 
other small halls, as well as committee 
rooms, reception rooms, roof garden, power 
plant, storage rooms, skating rink, restau 
rant, etc., also will be provided for 

The underlying thought in erecting this 


auditorium is to provide a building which 
will satisfactorily serve the most diversified 
uses—a requirement for large and small 
conventions—and_ will include complete 
facilities for industriai expositions, auto 
mobile shows, concerts, grand balls, meet- 
ings for religious services, labor unions 
and fraternal organizations, athletic meets, 
military drills, indoor baseball, circus or 
large theatrical displays, horse shows and 
similar attractions. . 

The taxpayers of Cincinnati have already 
voted $250,000 to begin work on the build- 
ing, and it is expected that if more is re- 
quired to carry out the plans as outlined it 
will be easily forthcoming. °

American Civic Association 


lhe American Civic Association cele 
brated its tenth anniversary by holding an 
unusually important convention in Wash 
ington, D. C., December 2, 3 and 4 

Following a pleasant habit inaugurated 
some four years ago, the opening session 
was devoted to greetings and short state 
ments of progress from various allied or- 
ganizations. 

rhe first evening session was devoted to 
“Washington, the Federal City.” The ad- 
dress of the President of the Association, 
|. Horace McFarland, entitled “Wanted 
American City Planning for American 
Cities,” was read at that session. Mr. Mc- 
Farland congratulated the United States 
that its capital city had been started and 
grown to a plan definitely made for it, and 
recommended that all American cities should 
imitate the example of the capital city. He 
emphasized the importance of American 
city planning for American cities to con 
form to their especial needs as to physical 
development and as to the administration 
of cities under our democratic form of 
government. [Emphasis was also placed on 
the need for comprehensive city planning 
for small cities as distinguished from the 
large cities. Other addresses of that even 
ing session were by Col. William W. Harts 
and by Hon. Henry B. I’. Macfarland, both 
of Washington 

Mr. John Nolen, of Cambridge, Mass., 
presided at the city planning session on 
Thursday afternoon. The speakers at that 
session included: Thomas Adams, of the 
Conservation Commission of Canada; Ar 
nold W. Brunner, of New York; Richard 
B. Watrous, of Washington, and George | 
Ford, of New York. 


Other important subjects considered at 
the convention included: “Recreation for 
Congested Population,” by Mr. George A 
Parker, Superintendent of Parks, Hart 
ford, Conn.; “Children at Work in Gar- 


dens,” by Mrs. John T. D. Blackburn, of 
Albany, N. Y., who illustrated with stere- 
opticon slides a splendid work that has been 
conducted in her city for enlisting the ac-

Studies of Trees. 1914. 253 pp. Nu- 
merous photographs. $1.60 
This volume deals with the identification of trees; 
their nature, habits and growth: insects and diseases 
which attack them; their grouping and planting; the 
pruning and care of trees; common kinds of wood 
ind their uses; and forestry in its many aspects. It is 
intended as a quide for outdoor work, a manual for 
school use, or merely a readable book of information. 
The language is non-technical. Each tree is identi- 
fied by the mest prominent characteristic which dis 
tinguishes it at a glance from all others at all sea- 
sons, and careful comparisons are made between trees 
f different species but of similar appearance 
The “Studies of Trees” are also obtainable in pam 
phlet form, each pamphlet devoted to a particular 
study. The prices range from 5 to 15 cents.

American Sewerage Practice; Vol. I, De- 
sign of Sewers. 1914. 747 pp. Photo-

Lack of uniformity in American sewerage practice 
has been due largely to the absence of readily avail- 
able information covering the methods of different en- 
gineers. The series entitled “American Sewerage 
Practice” will serve as a valuable contribution toward 
tandardization by presenting in compact, convenient 
form an immense amount of material dealir ng with 
theory and rules of practice in the design and opera 
tion of sewerage works. The scope of Vol. I (De 
sign of Sewers) is seen from the chapter headings, 
which are as follows: “The General Arrangement of 
Sewerage Systems”; “Flow of Water in Pipes and 





Channels”; “Vel ocities and Grades”; ‘Measurement 


of Flowing Water”; “Quantity of Sew age”; “Precipi 
tation”; “Formulas for Estimating Storm-water 
Flow”; “The Rational Method of Estimating Storm- 
water Flow Run-off in Sewer Design’; “Gaging 
Storm-water Flow in Sewers”; Sewer Pipe”; “‘The 


Design of Masonry Sewers”: “Examples of Sewer 
Sections and the Loads on Sewers”; “The Analysis of 
Masonry Arches”: “Street Inlets, Catch-basins 
Manholes”; “Junctions, Siphons, Bridges and F! ish: 
ing Devices”: “Regulators, Overflows, Outlets, Tide 
Gates and Ventilation”; “Sewage Pumping Stations.”

with the same dominant purpose in view \mong the 
hapters by well-known writers and workers may be 
mentioned “High School Education as a Social Enter

sioner of Education; ‘The High School as a Social 
Center,” by Clarence Arthur Ve try, and “Vocati 
Guidance and the High School,’ by Meyer ae mmfield

The Mental Health of the School Child. 


1914. 463 pp. $2.00 

The shockingly wide prevalence of physical defects 
(as distinguished from disease) in school children is 
indicated by the statement made in this volume that 
“Seventy-two and three-tenths per cent of 230,243 


children examined in New York City in 1911 were 
reported as requiring treatment,” and that 1 
defects in children are not restricted to any clime, 
race, environment, or social c ondition. ” The book « 
sists of a compilation of papers and addresses by the 
author, based upon extensive statistical studies and 
dealing with the best methods of examining for and 
correcting such defects. The fundamental idca is 
that “A child abnormal in body probably cannot re 
main normal in mind; he will tend to become morally 
perverse and criminal.” It is shown that some kind 
of psychological analysis should be applied as a regu 
lar part of the activity of all city and state school sys 
tems, and special educational processes planned for ex 
ceptional children, not only as a matter of justice both 
to the normal children and the defectives, but as a nec 
essary feature of sensible and economic administra 
tion.

A New Line of Mazda Lamp Fix- 
tures for Street Lighting Service 


The introduction of high 


candle power 


Mazda lamps and the new conditions under 
which they operate required the design of an 


entire new line of fixtures to ac- 
commodate them properly. The 
several specific reasons that have in- 
duced the development of these dis- 
tinctly different types of fixtures 
are the following: 

(1) The intense brilliancy of the 
lamp requires that the light source 
be screened in order to obviate all 
the disadvantages from glare. 

(2) The lamp in operation is de- 
signed to reach a very high tem- 
perature, and it is essential that the 

xture be so ventilated that it is 
maintained at a temperature which 
will do it no injury. 

(3) The lamp must be protected 


from moisture and atmospheric 
changes. 
(4) The shape and size of the 


bulb being different from that of 
previous standards of the vacuum 
lamp, it was necessary to make a 
fixture that would bring the light 
center to the correct location 

(5) Due to the fact that high- 
current series lamps operate at a 
very much greater efficiency, it is 
very desirable to provide an indi- 
vidual compensator in each lamp 
that will increase the current in the 
lamp from 6.6 or 7.5 amperes to 15 
or 20 amperes, as the 400-candle- 
power lamps operate at I5 amperes 
and the 600 and 1,000-candle-power 
lamps at 20 amperes. 

To provide for these contingen- 
cies, the General Electric Company 
has designed complete lines of street 
lighting fixtures that fulfill every 
requirement. In general, these fix- 
tures may be divided into three 
different classes, namely, bracket 
type, pendant type and ornamental 
type. 

The bracket and center span sus- 
pension fixtures have been rede- 
signed to accommodate the follow- 
ing reflecting equipment: radial 
wave reflector, concentric reflector 
or concentric reflector with pris- 
matic refractor. 

_ The pendant units have been de- 
signed in two different classes

The Draeger Self-Rescuer 


\ unique little device, which is commonly 
alled a helmet, although this particular one is 
not a helmet at all, has just been introduced 
y The Draeger Oxygen Apparatus Company 
f Pittsburgh, Pa., and is known as _ th 


Draeger Self-Rescuer The machine got tts 
name from the fact that it has assisted miners 
in rescuing themselves after an explosion. !: 
cases of this kind it is adjusted quickly, and 

e miner may penetrate the deadly “after 


lamp” and return to the outside in safety 
Because of its lightness and simplicity, how 
ever, it has greatly interested practical gas 
men, and in spite of the fact that it has be 
on the market but a few months, a number of 
rger plants throughout the country hav 
already adk pted it.

plete seal from the outside air without using a 
hood, and in this way the wearer has no en 
cumbrances around the head Che little rna 
chine weighs about 6% pounds, and may be 
wrapped up in a package no larger than a 
woman’s handbag when not in service. It is 
put into use in a few seconds, and can be used 
by the most ignorant laborer without previous 
training. It is said to be the most inexpensive 
helmet which has ever been brought to the 
attention of the gas industry, not only in first 
cost hut in upkeep. A laborer may remain in 
the most poisonous gases for 30 minutes with 
this little machine without sign of injury, and 
after this length of service another charge may 
be inserted within a few seconds which will 
enable him to return for another 30 minutes. 
The accompanying cut indicates how the 
Self-Rescuer is used. The respired air passes 
ver the granulated caustic potash as it passes 
thro ugh tube “L” in passing down to breathing 
hag “A.” Here it meets fresh oxygen from the 
cvlinder “S,” and when the wearer again in 
hales the mixture it is 
enriched with oxygen to 
replace that which was 
consumed by the previous 
breath, returning again 
through potash cartridge 
“P.” thence through tube 
“TI” to the lungs of the 
wearer. In this manner 
the respired air is puri- 
fied two different times, 
and the result is that the 
carbonic acid gas of res 
piration, which would 
otherwise be very annoy- 
ing as well as dangerous 
to the helmet man, is re- 
duced to less than half 
of 1 per cent. The oxy- 
gen which is fed from 
the cylinder “S” merely 
replaces that which is be- 
ing consumed constantly 
by the wearer; it thus 
simply renews the fresh 
air and does not give a 
pure oxygen feed, as

THE “PENNSYLVANIA

The “Pennsylvania Rainmaker” is a lawn 
and garden sprinkler manufactured by the 
Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company, of Phila 
delphia, which has been adopted for use on 
numerous public parks, private and 
athletic club grounds in this country and Eu 

pe. The municipal parks of Philadelphia 
and Chicago are among its first users 

This device is made on the turbine principle 
lhe water coming from the nozzle strikes the 
turbine paddles, turning the wheel, which car 
ries the jet around the circular base approxi- 
mately eight times a minute. The water is dis 
tributed so evenly and gradually over the entir« 
area covered that it sinks into the ground 
instead of running off into low places. With 
a pressure of from 50 to 60 pounds the sprink- 
ler will throw heavy or medium drops of fine 
spray evenly from the center to the extrem 
edge of a circular area of from 60 to 75 feet 
in diameter, a distance long enough to give the 
water time to lose the chill so harmful to 
tender plants. As regularly made, the “Rain- 
maker” requires only a 34-inch hose, but other 
sized couplings are readily furnished. There 
ure no cog-wheels or gears to get out of order, 
and the sprinkler works perfectly without at 
tention after starting. It rests on flat runners 
which are adjustable to uneven ground and 
hillsides.

Amusement Devices for Private Use 


The private playground outfits manufactured 
by the Cyclone Fence Company, of Waukegan, 
lil., change the lawn or yard into a playground 
where many children can be accommodated in 
small space. They are strongly constructed to 
stand rough and constant usage. The portable 
outfit No. 1 includes swing, horizontal bar, 
trapeze and swinging rings, with board base, 
all metal parts heavily hot galvanized, and is a 
suitable eres for rest rooms in stores 
and public buildings, to entertain and occupy 
children; it requires space 6 by 8 feet and 10 
feet high. The center uprights and top cross 
piece are heavy steel tubing and are coupled 
with extra heavy malleable fittings throughout. 
Stationary outfit No. 2 is similar, except that 
it has posts of sufficient length and suitable 
bases to be set in concrete. The combination 
outfit is furnished in three units, the most com- 
plete of which includes swing, horizontal bar, 
trapeze, swinging rings, baby swing, teeter- 
totter and climbing pole. The exercise and en- 
tertainment are continuous in using this appa- 
ratus; one part is laid aside and another imme- 
diately used. No ladders or climbing are 
necessary to change the apparatus. All the 
parts are interchangeable. These outfits are 
designed to give the maximum of play effi- 
ciency for the minimum of space used. 

Boards of education and superintendents of 
schools are advocating the private playground 
outfit to supplement the public playground 
The organized exercise afforded by this home

“Improved Creosote Oil” 

This is the title of a 16-page pamphlet by 
P. C. Reilly, which is being distributed by the 
Republic Creosoting Company, of Indianapolis, 
Ind. It contains extracts from a paper read 
before the 1914 convention of the American 
Wood Preservers’ Association in New Orleans, 
in which Mr. Reilly shows that the “bleeding” 
of treated timber, especially in the form of 
street paving blocks, is due to adulteration of 
the preservative. It is claimed that the use of 
an oil in accordance with the specifications of 
the Reilly improved creosote oil will eliminate 
a civic nuisance and provide a wood block 
pavement that will not only show ultimate 
economy, but will insure a clean, durable, hand- 
some and sanitary street.

size from %-inch to 2-inch. For “sensibility’ 
tests self-cleaning valves are provided, through 
which 1/32-inch, 1/16-inch or 44-inch flow tests 
may be secured. The inlet valve is slow open- 
ing, eliminating water hammer and undue 
strains on meter. The valve on the outlet side 
of meters is quick opening, enabling the flow 
to be controlled as when in actual service, and 
giving absolute control over the test at all 
times. The scale platform and base stand flat 
on the floor, without rollers to affect stability 
during test. The tank is rectangular and oc- 
cupies the least possible amount of floor space 
There are gauges for accurately determining 
pressure at both inlet and outlet, thus indicat- 
ing loss of head due to meter friction. The 
price of this tester makes it an interesting pos- 
sibility even for small water works, and its 
completeness and its money-saving feature 
compel the attention of managers of large 
plants.

Concrete Curb Protection 

The steel curb guard invented by Samuel H 
Dolbear, president of the American Steel sar 
Manufacturing Company, of San Francisco, is 
of solid steel construction without counter- 
sunk bolt heads and detachable pic le de- 
vice to corrode and break apart. The rounded 
outer head conforms in contour to the em- 
bedding concrete; its flat underside eliminates 
any wedging effect. The head is so constructed 
that expansion takes place entirely outside the 
concrete. Any impact is carried by the metal 
portion of the bar extending into the solid 
concrete and at right angles from the direction 
of the blow. The metal portions carrying the 
stresses are nearly 2 inches in combined width: 
thus the impact load is distributed over an 
area of nearly 24 square inches per lineal foot. 
The broad base or foot furnishes a_ solid 
anchorage. The bar cannot be severed from 
the concrete without completely destroying the 
curb \ neat appearance, efficiency, perma- 
nency and ease in construction result from the 
use of such protection for concrete curbs.

A Big Pressure Test 

The requirements for the test of fire hose 
manufactured by the Empire Rubber & Tire 
Company, of Trenton, N. J., for that city, in- 
cluded withstanding a pressure of 300 pounds. 
Final tests were recently made, and every one 
of the 50-foot sections withstood the 300 
pounds with hardly a perceptible move. Eleven 


AND MANUFACTURERS 8s 
sections took 400 pounds, and the elongatior 
was scarcely nella The most remarkabl 
feature of the test was the successful subjec 


tion of one section to a pressure of | 
pounds. This section was selected at random 
by Assistant Chief Stackhouse from the sixty 
under inspection. The hose is double-cott 
jacketed and 2% inches in diameter 

















JEFFERY QUAD TRUCK WITH BAIN WAGON TRAILERS 


Saving Money in Hauling 
Road Materials 


A recent test of the Jeffery Quad truck, 
made by The Thomas B. Jeffery Company, of 
Kenosha, Wis., excited considerable interest 
among contractors, highway commissioners 
and city officials. This truck, with a hand- 
operated dump body of two tons’ capacity and 
pulling two bottom-dump Bain wagons as trail- 
ers, is said to have shown a saving over horse 
wagons of $35.43 a day in hauling gravel from 
railroad cars on a public team track to a con- 
crete road-building operation 2.7 miles away. 
rhe Quad, with its two trailers, hauled 7 tons 
or more to the load, and with the aid of two 
extra shovelers it did as much work as 9 
teams—or 18 horses, 9 wagons and 9g drivers. 

The Jeffery Quad is designed to carry a load 
of 4,000 pounds in a body weighing 1,200 
pounds; that is, the combined weight of load 
and body should not exceed 5,200 pounds. But 
by reason of the fact that every one of the 
four wheels is an active worker—the front 
wheels pulling while the rear wheels push— 
this truck is enabled to pull a semi-trailer or 
one or two trailers behind it. The automatic 
locking differential in each drive shaft (one 


front and one rear) puts the force into any 
wheel that can get traction The four-wheel 
steer gives a short turning radius and reduces 
accident. The rear wheels follow perfectly 
the track of the front wheels, and thus, becaus« 
only one track is broken instead of two, it is 
easy for the truck to pull through snow, mud 
sand, etc. With the four-wheel brake, on a 
fairly good road, the truck can be brought to a 
stop from full speed in from 8 to 12 feet. Th 
maintenance cost is small, 
is pulled over obstacles by the front wheels in 
stead of being bounced over them by the rear 
wheels. 

The company’s new pamphlet, Series A, Ni 
2, gives an interesting account of this new 


truck.

A New Dumping Wagon 

\ new model dumping wagon, 
illustrated herewith, has just 
been brought out by The Tiffin 
Wagon Company, of Tiffin, 
Ohio, that has a number of note- 
wort hy features 

A patented equalizer, working 
by spring tension on the chains, 
which run the full length of the 
ody, provides for the raising of 
the fatter one slightly in ad- 
vance of the other, so that there 
is no chance for sticking, and 
once there is an overlapping 
flange the bottom is absolutely tight. A pat 
ented king bolt in connection with a special 
fth-wheel construction allows the wagon t 
tip in any direction without strain. On account 
. the inequalities of the ground where most 
dumping wagons have to work, this seems a 
particularly valuable feature. The bodies are 
of very staunch design, of oak heavily ironed, 
and with wrought steel hinges. A short wheel 
ase allows turning in close quarters, and the 
arched rear axle aids clearance over go 
— load. The winding device is said t 
ol proof.’ F 

It is further stated that while this is the most 
staunch and advanced model the company has 
ever built, certain economies have been worked 
out in production that allow the sale of this 
new model No. 5 dump wagon at a less price 
than former models.

“Saving the Dollars 
That Die Young’’ 


EVERYBODY who writes 
business letters works in 
the ‘‘Letter Factory.”’ No 
matter what business you are in, 
you are also a /etter manufacturer. 


What Do Your Letters Cost? 


HE maximum cost of the average business letter is about NINE CENTS. 

The minimum cost is FIVE CENTS. The average cost is SEVEN CENTS 

apiece. A corporation that turns out only 200 letters a day pays $14 a day— 
over $4,000 per annum—just for writing letters. 


Analyze Your Letter Factory 


The operating expense of your Letter Plant is governed by the working cost 
of two factors. ‘These factors are (exclusive of postage): 
1. Your human helpers—stenographers. THEY REPRESENT 95% of the working cost. 
2. The writing-machines that make the letters. THEY REPRESENT LESS THAN 
% of your letter-making cost. 
Stop and think! Are you, as a business man, willing to hamper, “tie up” ° 
and decrease the efficiency of the 954 factor of your plant, in order to 
“economize” on the 5% factor? 


Can you afford to do without the superior service which you will get from a 
new equipment of Royal Typewriters—the 5% factor—to increase the efficiency 


o,f 


of your 95% investment in labor ? Price $100

The American City Bureau completed its most recent campaign, at Blue- 
field, W. Va., last month. This campaign brought the Bluefield Chamber 
of Commerce the financial strength essential to its success. The above 
quotation from the Chamber’s secretary shows what he thinks of the way 
in which this strength was secured. The campaign at Bluefield, however, 


M2 ny PE 


brought the Chamber more than financial strength. Following are a few 
more paragraphs from a recent letter by Mr. Boykin, which tell the story: 






‘The active campaign is over. There are 294 memberships at $25 a year for three years 
The teams are still engaged in a spirited competition, and the probability is that the member- 
Hy ship will reach 350 before the first of January. 


“The whole movement is an example of masterful attention to details and of the value 
of scientific organization. Experts of the American City Bureau staff relieved me of all 
} responsibility for the details of the campaign. They interfered with my office routine only 
; to the extent to which my own interest in the work drew me into the campaign. 


“‘Lunches were held every noon, at which Mr. Wilson gave the people of Bluefield a new 
| vision of community work. Withal, he made no promises as to what the Chamber will 
do in the future. We shall not be embarrassed with promises which cannot be kept. 


“The campaign was predicated upon the opportunity for our citizens, through the 
Chamber of Commerce, to repay to the city some of their debt of citizenship. This is 
the keynote of the work of the Bureau. They inspire new ideals, the spirit of giving, the 
spirit of working together, the spirit of doing something for the community which has done 
so much for each individual. 





“T consider that this new spirit of co-operation is more valuable to our organization than 
the material benefits of the campaign. I say this advisedly, appreciating that nuc only was 
the amount of our dues raised, but the total number of members is greatly increased and 
an income sufficient for our needs is guaranteed for three years.”’ 





The results secured at Bluefield are simply one more indication of the 
results that could be secured for your organization. 
Won't you ask us to tell you how?

Good taste and good judgment go together in fencing. Among the varied styles of Excelsior 
Rust Proof fence you will find one just suited to your location—a fence that will not spoil but will 
enhancethe view. Excelsior Rust proof fences will last because they are not the tumble-down kind. 
The large wires are fastened together with a patent clamp so that they cannot slip. The fence 
stands erect, without sagging. Best of all, it is dip galvanized. The spelter is put on much heavier 
than on ordinary fences. That's why Excelsior Rust Proof fences have longer life than ordinary 
fences and are not eaten by rust. Ask your hardware dealer also about Excelsior Rust Proof

THE AMERICAN CITY 

















Imagine a manufacturing business 
having millions of customers scattered 
over the country, with millions of ac- 
counts on its books, most of them 
less than $30 a year, and including 
a multitude of 5-cent charges. 


Consider it as having shops and 
offices in thousands of cities, and 
reaching with its output 70,000 places, 
more than there are post offices in the 
United States. Think of the task of 
patroling 16,000,000 miles of connect- 
ing highways constantly in use. 


This gives you a faint idea of the 
business of managing the Bell System. 


Not all the 8,500,000 telephones 
are in use at once, but the manage- 
ment must have facilities always ad- 
equate to any demands for instant, 
direct communication. 


Managing the Business of 8,500,000 Telephones 


In so vast an undertaking, every 
branch of the organization must work 
in harmony, guided by one policy. 
The entire plant must be managed in 
the light of accumulated experience, 
and with the most careful business 
judgment. 


The aim of the Bell System is to 
make the telephone of the utmost use- 
fulness. This requires an army of 
loyal men and women, inspired by a 
leadership having a high sense of its 
obligations to the public. 


Animated by the spirit of service, 
and unhampered by red tape, the 
150,000 Bell employes have the cour- 
age to do the right thing at the right 
time upon their own initiative. They 
work together intelligently as a busi- 
ness democracy to give the public 
good service.

CITY AND PARK TREES 


The trees of our cities and parks are becoming beautifully less from lack of care and attention, note 
the broken limbs and dead wood that strew the ground after a storm. 

I can remedy this condition by making an inspection, and furnishing experienced men to carry out 
the necessary work, or furnish directions from which local men can do the same.

This is the brick being laid almost exclusively in Baltimore City, 
where every street and alley is being repaved. 


Toronto specifies it exclusively for brick pavements. 


Cincinnati specifications say: “ Wire-Cut-Lug Brick preferred.” 


New York State Highway Department is using Wire-Cut-Lug 
on the great Lake Shore road construction, six miles long. 


After three months of thorough investigation, Sears, Roebuck & 
Co., of Chicago, have paved the streets adjacent to their immense 
p'ant and huge buildings with Wire-Cut Lug Brick. 


Twenty-three independent competing companies make Wire-Cut- 


Lug Brick.

Studebaker Uniform Pressure Power Street Flusher 





Make Three Dollars Do 
the Work of Four— 


You can do it if you buy a Studebaker Uniform Pressure Power 
Street Flusher because it will do a minimum of 33 1-3°% more 
work than any of the Pneumatic type. 


Clean four blocks instead of three—twenty instead of fifteen— 
four miles instead of three—three flushers instead of four, saving 
the cost of one flusher, team, harness and man to operate——see 
how it counts up— it’s a big saving and remember this is the 
minimum, frequently a saving of 50% is effected and in some 
instances much more. 

We will be glad to sell you either a Power or Pneumatie, which ever you want 


we have them both—but if it is greater efficiency you are looking for, there is 
but one, and that is a Studebaker Power Flusher. 


Serial A-821! will tell you more about it. We will be glad to send it to you.

e Passing of the Primitive 
Carrying is not Hauling 


Primitive men carried their loads. Then they found they could drag more 
than they could carry. They could roll more than they could drag. On 
wheels they could pull still more. The history of transportation on land 
is a history of the pulled load. There is only one exception and that is the 
motor truck; and it has already been proved that the motor truck will reach 
its ultimate field only with the aid of trailers—only when primitive carry- 
ing is combined with practical pulling.
