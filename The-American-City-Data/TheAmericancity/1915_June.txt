CAST IRON PIPE | 









From New York Harbor 
to the Golden Gate 


The verdict of the country is practically unanimous on the question of 
using cast iron pipe for water works distribution systems. Cast Iron Pipe 
possesses sterling advantages which time has never shaken; and, in fact, 
each passing year strengthens the standing of cast iron pipe by adding to a 
record for permanence already 250 years old. 


Bell and Spigot Cast Iron Pipe 


is the acknowledged standard as to weight, length, and type of joint. 
There's economy in using it. It is the only logical answer when comparing 
Cast lron Pipe with The Substituted Products. It is the pipe which stands 
for the greatest degree of service and economy; the pipe which will last the 
longest and give the best service at the lowest cost.

HE everlasting quality 
of Cast Iron Pipe is 
born in the “‘ Eternal 
Hills” of iron ore. 
{°>Simple, elementary pro- 
cesses of smelting shape this 
ore into pipe, removing only 
the earthy matter and render- 
ing the iron soft, strong, 
tough and of even grain. 

In these processes no radical chem- 
ical change takes place, and therefore 
no chemical controversy can ever 
arise as to the durability and efficiency 


of

A New Book of Great Importance to 
Progressive Americans 


THE CITY MANAGER 


By Harry Aubrey Toulmin, Jr., J.D., F.S.S. 


HE people of the American city are demanding a dollar for a dollar deal. The 
idea that ability to direct the city’s destiny is a divine gift common to the 
politically chosen is meeting its nemesis. |More than four hundred cities through the 
commission form of government have eliminated aldermen and mayors 
and have chosen a less involved, a less complicated and a more adequate 
form of government. Still others have gone a step further and have hired a 
city manager, thus converting misdirected city government into an efficient 
agency of community welfare. 

Mr. Toulmin, with first-hand information at his command, gives a com- 
plete summary of this new form of municipal government, as it has been 
adopted in many cities of the South and West with marked success, as 
well as by many commission government cities all over the country. This 
work goes so thoroughly into the advantages and disadvantages of the 
commission and city government plans and into the actual workings of the 
city manager method in the foremost cities which have adopted it, that it 
is bound to prove a telling factor in the development of sound public 
opinion upon every important question.

5) By reason of use of the “Ford” fittings, in connection with the 

Wabash’ cover, meter may be installed or removed through cover 

ne minute, and it is never necessary to dig up or disturb corer of boz. 


The ** Wabash "’ Box with Yoke Fitting. 

Tt is box (Fig. 1), for outside setting of meter, consists of a hood- 

ape d cover supplied with patent lid and inner lid, and provided 
with a “yoke” and fittings to receive the meter. In this type of box 
the yoke fittings are screwed onto risers from the service line, and 
meter held in piace near the surface. These fittings and yoke become 

4 permanent part of the meter setting. 

These settings are made in three sizes for %-, 34- and 1-inch, 
meters and require standard vitrified tile of en 18- and 20-inch, 
respectively. Weights of covers are 38, 45 and 54 lbs., respectively. 


““ Wabash "’ Cover with “‘ Open Nut ”’ Fitting. 

In this type of setting (Fig. 2) the cover is identical with regular 
yoke pattern, but the ‘‘Open Nut" connection is substituted for the 
yoke with its wedge arrangement. This is a thoroughly dependable 
arrangement, but is offered as a cheaper substitute for the regular 

“Wabash"’ setting. In this box, meter may be installed and re 
moved through neck. Female part of fitting, — ly in place, 
is started on to meter spud and the whole drop; into position, 
engaging male part of fitting which is permanent part of service riser 
and nut serewed up with wrench. 

Installation. 

The ‘‘Wabash” boxes may be set on standard tile, or 
may be made on the ground. We are prepared to omele rreaadl 
well-made and practically collapsible forms for making this concrete 
pipe in any size desired.

Doing Business with a Business Concern 


The business man is an important 
factor in your daily life and happiness. 

He may raise wheat or cattle; he 
may manufacture flour or shoes; he 
may run a grocery or a drygoods store; 
he may operate a copper mine or a 
telephone company. He creates or 
distributes some commodity to be 
used by other people. 

He is always hard at work to sup- 
ply the needs of others, and in return 
he has his own needs supplied. 

All of us are doing business with 
business men so constantly that we 
accept the benefits of this intercourse 
without question, as we accept the air 
we breathe. Most of us have little to 
do with government, yet we recog- 
nize the difference between business 
methods and government methods. 

We know that it is to the interest 


of the business man to do something 
for us, while the function of the gov- 


ernment man is to see that we do 
something for ourselves—that is, to 
control and regulate. 

We pay them both, but of the two 
we naturally find the business man 
more get-at-able, more human, more 
democratic. 

Because the telephone business has 
become large and extensive, it requires 
a high type of organization and must 
employ the best business methods. 

The Bell System is in the business 
of selling its commodity—telephone 
service. It must meet the needs of 
many millions of customers, and teach 
them to use and appreciate the service 
which it has provided. 

The democratic relation between 
the customer and the business con- 
cern has been indispensable, providing 
for the United States the best and 
most universal telephone service of 
any country in the world.

planning represents a_ scientific 
\merican cities. It stands 
for guided and directed development rather 
than haphazard growth; it stands for intel- 
ligent progress. In that sense its value is 
potentially inestimable. 

The advent of city planning within the 
last few years, however, is being hailed as 
a deliverance rather than a revival, ac- 
claimed as the first rather than the second 
coming. As a matter of fact, the planning 
of cities has been a well-studied and applied 
science for centuries; and even in America 
casual research reveals traces of the lost art 
in the early record and existant lines of 
many of our cities. In that respect city 
planning appears to be a sporadic science; 
and the increasing birth rate of city plan- 
ning commissions and planning legislation, 
all destined to accomplish a great work in 
the betterment of American cities, repre- 
sents a renaissance and a recoming.

development has almost always preceded 
city planning, invariably accompanies it, 
and is ordained in every case to succeed it. 
City planning to-day is the revivalist, park 
development the resident pastor.

In view of the importance park design 
bears to city building, and in order to put

city planning. Although fundamentally park

less bedecking, will be impossible, at least 
until the general design has been accom- 
plished. Until a park plan has been firmly 
laid out and “nailed on the ground” as they 
say, all attempts at decoration should be dis- 
couraged. In other words, ornamentation 
should follow construction, and the initial 
expenditure should always be devoted to 
accomplishing the park framework. There 
have been many cases in the past where 
parks have been elaborated by planting even 
before a definite walk system or other de- 
sign had been prepared, with the usual re- 
sult from getting the cart before the horse. 


Building Operations Affected by 
Park Plans 


The fifth recommendation is that accepted 
park plans be considered public property, 
open to the perusal of all or any that may 
be interested. Intelligently prepared park 
design, assured of exact execution inde- 
pendently of political shift, will influence 
the character of building operations en- 
circling each park and in a measure guide 
the development along lines prescribed by 
the civic designer in his selection and rec- 
ommendation of the respective park areas. 
Furthermore, if city planning is to be prac- 
tical, the development of its parks must 
prove profitable; and the parks will not con- 
fer direct pecuniary benefits on a city un- 
less sufficiently assured of development that 
the citizens can place reliance on the char- 





THE AMERICAN CITY 


acter each park will ultimately have, to the 
extent of launching building operations in 
accordance with and to some extent in ad- 
vance of its actual improvement. 


Special Favoritism V ersus Logical Allotment 


The sixth and final recommendation is 
that an impartial system of park expenditure 
be adopted. Projected park development 
will serve as stimulus for civic growth only 
when the citizens have confidence in its 
eventual execution. The too prevalent con- 
dition of park development being dependent 
upon political pull must go; sectional favor- 
itism must give way to logical allotment, 
and expenditures must be in accordance 
with park requirements rather than accord- 
ing to dictates of those in power. The pub- 
lic mind, in turn, must be made to under- 
stand that evenly distributed expenditure 
throughout all sections of a city may rep- 
resent the most illogical of all methods of 
park development; that a park system is the 
possession of the city as a whole, each sec- 
tion benefiting in proportion to its civic 
participancy. An honest policy of park de- 
velopment, with civic betterment for its 
goal, must govern its appropriations and ex- 
penditures in accordance with carefully pre- 
pared estimates based upon accepted and 
published park plans, all component and 
contributing to the execution of a consistent 
city plan. 





What the Health Inspector and Patrolman 
Can Do for Recreation 
By Louis Heaton Pink 


E have been centuries building walls 
W between the departments of city 
government. Now we are tearing 
them down. We had come to believe that 
the health inspector, the policeman, the 
building inspector and all other officials 
have their own ficld and that coéperation 
is impossible. Policemen and inspectors 
have to a certain extent become automa- 
tons, creatures of rule and habit. They are 
not encouraged to use brains and judg- 
ment. Now a humanizing process is going 
on. 

In few cities has the health inspector any- 
thing to do with playgrounds. Yet it is 
plain that he should have. 

Are not some of the playgrounds in the 
small parks of your city untidy? Are the 


toilet facilities sufficient? Are the drinking 
fountains sanitary? Few cities can give 
their playgrounds’a clean bill of health. 
The conditions which prevail in too many 
children’s play spaces breed not only dis- 
comfort but disease. 

New York licenses stands for the sale 
of refreshments in its parks and breathing 
spots. So do most cities. Does not the city, 
impliedly at least, warrant that the colored 
candy and pink lemonade are free from 
danger? Are they? 

At the playground, children from homes 
where there is contagion come into close 
contact with hundreds of other children. 
They use the same apparatus, play the same 
games. The health inspector should assist 
the playground attendant in keeping chil-

Some would say that all children should 
be examined by the health inspector before 
using the grounds, 


away from the 


I do not believe it wise. 
There is a limit to the Germanization of 
our cities. Compulsory examination of all 
would duplicate the work of the school 
nurses and physicians. But those cases 
which the playground attendant has ground 
to suspect should have attention. Every 
week children with skin disease or other 
ailments crop up, and the attendant should 
have the advice of the health inspector as 
to whether to allow these children to mix 
with the others. The inspector should also 
see that those who suffer from disease get 
proper medical care and that children who 
are weak should not over-strain. 


What the Police Can Do 

The growth of the foreign quarters in 
our cities has brought to the front the prob 
lem of the care of our large parks. Sun 
days and holidays they are invaded by vast 
crowds. Many of the people have no con- 
ception of the proper use of public breath- 
ing spaces. Shrubbery is torn, grass is 
trampled, flowers are plucked, litter is scat- 
tered. In New York, at least, the police 
have not measured up to the task of hand- 
ling this problem satisfactorily. Some 
Sundays large numbers of arrests are made. 
The newspapers will make a feature of this, 
perhaps the Mayor will hint that it is 
wrong, and the next Sunday arrests there 
will be none. It is absurd to jail large num- 
bers of people for trivial offenses. On the 
other hand, an arrest must now and then 
be made in a serious case or the beauty of 
the parks will be destroyed. 

The police assigned to the parks should 
be carefully chosen. They should know 
how to control people. It is especially im- 
portant that the captains of the park pre- 
cincts be specialists in the handling of 
crowds. There should also be closer co- 
operation between the park department and 
the police. 

The usefulness of small parks and play- 
grounds is sometimes destroyed by gangs 
of hoodlums. Young men who should be 
at work use them as hangouts. Some of 
the playgrounds are ill attended because 
the children fear to go there. One small 
park in lower Manhattan was for a time a 
rendezvous for pickpockets. Disreputable 
characters monopolized the benches and 
made it unsafe for the boys and girls.

City Planning Restrictions on Private Property

depend upon the use made of the 

land within its limits. City planning 
is the control and guidance of this use. The 
city exercises this control and guidance in 
two ways: (1) by taking the land or an 
interest in it, thus making it public property, 
and (2) by regulating it without taking, 
thus leaving it wholly in private ownership. 

In the construction of its streets, parks, 
and other public features, the city must 
have a property interest in the land to be 
used for that purpose. The land which the 
city holds is already devoted, as a general 
thing, to some specific public use. The city 
in its growth is, therefore, constantly in 
need of additional land, and must, as a rule, 
acquire it from private owners. 

In so far as the city is able to obtain the 
land it needs by voluntary agreement with 
the owner, the acquisition of land for city 
planning purposes involves no restrictions 
upon private property rights. In some sys- 
tems of government this power of obtain- 
ing land by private sale is the extent of the 
city’s right. In Vienna, for instance, the 
city cannot construct a new street or widen 
an old one, unless the owner of the neces- 
sary land is willing to sell it and the city 
is ready to give the price he asks. But 
Vienna and other cities so limited in their 
right to acquire land feel that they are 
denied powers necessary for their develop- 
ment, and in most cases are trying to amend 
their laws in this respect. In almost all 
civilized countries, cities already have the 
power to take land for public use without 
the consent of the owner. 


Yee physical characteristics of a city 


Condemnation as a Limitation Upon 
Private Rights 

The right of “condemnation” (as invol- 
untary taking is sometimes called) is in all 
civilized countries coupled with the obliga- 
tion to make reasonable compensation. 
Nevertheless, the liability to condemnation 
is a real restriction upon private property. 
The owner has often an attachment for his 
home which the city wants as a site for a 


[470] 


school house; the business man has his own 
plans for that extra 50 feet near his fac- 
tory. They do not want to sell at a fair 
price. 

The planning of the public features of a 
city is really the smaller part of the city 
planner’s task. The attainment of his com- 
plete aim is to put to its best use all the land 
in the city, whether it is privately or pub- 
licly owned. 

In the development of its public features 
the city greatly affects private property. 
The street system, for example, practically 
determines land subdivision and materially 
influences the use made by the owner of all 
privately owned land in the city. In the 
construction of these public features, the 
city is not legally restricting private rights, 
but is acting as a private owner of an ex- 
tensive property might do in similar cir- 
cumstances. It is the privately laid out 
street system and other features public in 
character of Hampstead Gardens near Lon- 
don and Forest Hills in New York that 
make these suburbs as a whole much more 
admirable than the cities to which they 
belong. 


Regulation of Private Property 

But this influence of public on private 
development, great as it is, has been found 
to be insufficient. Cities the world over 
have become congested, and ordinances lim- 
iting the height and area of buildings have 
been found necessary; cities have become 
confused, and ordinances controlling the 
location of factories so as not to interfere 
with residences have become expedient. 
Thus in direct ways cities are beginning to 
regulate the use of private land. 

Many people have the feeling that they 
have, or ought to have, an absolute right in 
their own property, and that all such rights 
as that of condemnation or regulation are 
infringements on their proprietorship. No 
such absolute right exists at present or ever 
has existed in any country. The govern- 
ment or “State” (to use the language of 
jurisprudence) has always exercised a para- 
mount right in the property of its citizens, 


- 











THE 


and to-day the State may take not only their 
belongings, but their lives if the need be 
sufficient. This is as true in the United 
States as in other countries. In the 60's 
we requisitioned private property and 
passed conscription laws. Nor are these 
merely war rights. In time of peril by 
fire or flood or earthquake the State, here 
as everywhere else, has the same powers; 
and the reason why less may be taken in 
ordinary times is because the exercise of 
this paramount right must, like any other, 
be in accordance with the need—and in nor 
mal times the need is less. 

In this country ever since its foundation, 
citizens have been guaranteed certain rights 
regarded as fundamental. These guaranties 
are often called “bills of rights” and are 
contained in the written constitutions of our 
states and of the United States. Neither 
the United States nor any state can pass a 
statute, or do or authorize any act infring- 
ing upon these rights. Under these guar- 
anties the property owner is protected 
against any condemnation except for a pub 
lic purpose and upon payment of due com- 
pensation. 

The idea is rather generally prevalent 
that it is only here in the United States, or 
peculiarly here, that the individual is pro- 
tected in his private property rights. This 
feeling has very little foundation. The prin- 
ciples of law contained in our constitutional 
guaranties of private property prevail in all 
civilized countries. In some of them, like 
England, this protection is not contained in 
a written constitution, but is based upon the 
all-sufficient force of public opinion; in 
some countries, like Germany, this protec- 
tion is not, to the extent it is with us, based 
upon the action of the courts, but more on 
the knowledge and fairness of administra- 
tive bodies. In all foreign countries, too, 
legislatures are trusted more and courts less 
than with us. The differences between 
these countries and ours have been exag- 
gerated, but are material nevertheless. 

These ¢cifferences in the protection af 
forded to private property are not, however, 
the result of these formal differences in 
legal systems, but of different conceptions 
of matters of fundamental importance, such 
as, in the field of city planning: (1) the 
question of what constitutes a public use, 
and therefore what are the purposes for 
which property may be taken; and (2) 
what is the taking of a property right, and 


AMERICAN 


CITY 471 


what a mere regulation or adjustment of 
rights between property hese 
questions are by no mean simple, and have 
given us no little trouble in this country. 
Illustrations of our difficulties and the dif 
ferences between the point of view in other 
countries and ours will appear in the con- 
sideration of the specific city planning re 
strictions on private property later on. The 
meaning of fundamental conceptions like 
these varies with the age, 


owners, 


with the coun- 
try, and with the circumstances and condi- 
tions in the same age and country. Irriga 
tion, for instance, is a public purpose in a 
dry western state in this country, but not 
in an eastern state. 


The Principle of Eminent Dornain 


The reason why the State has the power 
to take land by eminent domain for a public 
use, and no other, is simple and sensible. 
The State exists for a purpose—that of 
serving its citizens. In the taking of prop- 
erty, as in all its other doings, it must act 
for the purpose for which it exists. Evi- 
dently no taking can be for the public un- 
less it is for a purpose useful to the public. 

When we come to apply this principle, 
we find difficulties in its application. Is the 
use of land by the municipality for working 
men’s cottages, or for resale in order to 
keep the price of land, and therefore rents, 
low, a public use? 
public purposes; 


In Germany these are 
in this country they are 
not, for, according to the decisions of our 
courts, they are businesses into which gov- 
ernment should not enter. But a munici 
pality may produce and sell gas or elec 
tricity and condemn property for the pur- 
pose. Thus theories as to the legitimate 
field of governmental action enter into the 
question of the usefulness to the public of 
a given course of governmental procedure ; 
and it is not strange that the answer in 
Germany, with its belief that governmental 
action should have a broad scope, should in 
many of these questions be different from 
that of a more individualistic people like 
ours. 

The State is not obliged to take all the 
rights in a given piece of land necessary 
for some public use. It may, it is true, 
take all these rights and dispose of those 
which it does not need. It may also take 


only the necessary rights, leaving the rest

Two Functions of Government 

Government has two functions: (1) the 
main function of regulating and adjusting 
the actions and property interests its 
inhabitants in their relations one with an- 
other and with outsiders, and (2) the inci- 
dental function of holding property for the

disposition by its residents of their garbage, 
and owns the garbage wagons and the in- 
cinerator with its appurtenant land for the 
destruction of that garbage. The distinc- 
tion between the action of the city in tak 
ing private land upon which to build the 
incinerator and in compelling a resident to 
use separate receptacles for ashes and gar- 
hage is clear. In the-one case is 
taken, in the other it is not: the first is a 
case of eminent domain, the second of “po 


property 


lice power” (as the power of regulation is 
called). 

But there are cases where the owner of 
land is deprived of actual rights of profit to 
him that are nevertheless cases of regula 
tion or exercise of- the police power. For 
instance, an owner may be forbidden to rent 
or occupy a tenement unfit for human occu- 
pation, although but for the prohibition he 
could easily rent it at a profit. Evidently 
the distinction between eminent domain and 
police power rests not altogether on what 
is and what is not a taking of property 
rights, but also in many cases upon theories 
as to what governments should and should

is not sufficiently an offense to the average 
citizen, or has not been such long 
for him to convince judges and courts 
the fact. 


Establishment of the City Plan 

Having considered some of the principles 
underlying all city planning restriction of 
private property, let us now take up, step 
by step, the planning of the city in the light 
of these principles. 

\n essential step in the planning of a 
city is the establishment of the plan on such 
a basis of law that it cannot with impunity 
be violated or departed from. This step 


enough 














THE 


should be taken as soon as the plan has been 
formulated, without waiting for any of it 
to be carried out. Wise planning antici- 
pates present needs by perhaps fifty years, 
in order that present construction may con- 
form to and aid proper future development. 
Wise planning covers the whole city, in or- 
der that it may be planned as a unit. Pres 
ent construction executes only such 
of the plan as immediate need demands, and 
financial ability permits. Even the acquisi- 
any extent of the land needed in 
the future seems difficult and often impos 
sible. Thus, the plan is a pattern to be filled 
in from time to time, and unless at the out- 
set the city has some method of making a 
general adherence to the entire plan binding 
upon land owners, it is sure to fail of reali- 
zation. 

Some foreign countries have in different 
degrees solved this difficult legal problem. 
In Germany, for instance, after any part of 
the city plan has been adopted, any person 
making improvements on his own land 
within the limits of future streets is not 
entitled to damages for the demolition of 
the improvements; but, on the contrary, if 
these improvements render street construc- 
tion more expensive, he must reimburse the 
city. No compensation is made the land- 
owner for subjecting his land to the city 
plan. 

City builders in this country have felt the 
importance of establishing the city plan, 
and have endeavored to do so; but our 
courts, after some vacillation, have declared 
that it cannot be done under the police 
power and without compensation, as in Ger- 
many and other foreign countries, but that 
compensation must be made. 

Evidently, by imposing a plan upon the 
land of a private owner, he is deprived of 
rights in his land: but the land in the tract 
planned cannot become building lots with 
out streets; nor does the planning so much 
deprive an owner of any right to build as 
tell him where to build on a tract that must 
be used partly for streets in any event. 
Here again our law is more individualistic 
than foreign law: here, too, we are less 
trustful of the fairness and ability of city 
officials. Improper, unfair planning, plan- 
ning unduly

the most urgent task of city planners to-day. 

Some of the advantages to be gained by 
means of a city plan made legally binding 
upon private landowners we in this country 
are trying to gain by other methods. 

One such method is the provision for an 
official city plan, binding upon the city and 
its officers until officially changed. [Excel 
lent as this is, it does not protect the plan 
from the encroachments and attacks of 
private interests. The records of the plan 
ning departments of many of our 
show how often private improvements have 
compelled the city to modify or abandon 
important features of their official plans. 

Another method is the provision, now 
quite common, requiring plans of private 
streets to be submitted for approval to some 
city authority before they are accepted by 
the city as public streets. The authority 
whose approval is required is usually a per 
son or a body like the City Surveyor, or the 
City Planning Commission, supposed to bé

able to pass upon the streets from the city 
planning point of view. Such a law does 
not in any way limit the legal rights of the 
landowner or increase those of the city 
The owner is still free to lay out streets on 
his land and sell house lots or build houses 
on the street as he pleases. The law does 
not add in any way to the power of the city 
to reject the street for any that 
seems good to it. The landowner has never 


reason 


had the legal right to compel the city to 
accept any street as a public street. The 
object of the statute is to induce the land 
owner to consult the city before laying out 
the street, hoping thereby to induce him to 
lay it out in conformity to the city plan, 
for fear that otherwise it might be rejected 
by the city. The trouble is that the land- 
owner is not afraid. All too often, in fact 
in spite of the regulation, the owner lays 
out his streets as he pleases, and sells lots 
to innocent purchasers upon which they 
build their houses, only to find out that it is 
incumbent upon them to get the 
accepted, as they do.

474 THE 

Even with this additional step, the 
method outlined above has in practice 
proved less effective than the foreign 
method. The city usually finds itself prac 


tically unable to refuse to accept streets 
upon which so much has been spent, and 
unwilling to allow them to remain under 
private control. At best, the protection of 
the city by such a method could only be 
partial. The city plan may be infringed in 
many other ways than that of speculative 
housing development. For instance, such 
legislation does not prevent the building of 
large factories directly across important 
projected streets, or help to secure to the 
city a desired site for a public building or 
a much needed park. 


Excess Condemnation 


After making the city plan and protect- 
ing it so far as possible from attack by pri- 
vate interests, and before the construction 
of its public features can be begun, land 
must be acquired for the purpose. We have 
already seen that land can be condemned 
only for a public use. It follows that land 
only in an amount sufficient for that use 
can be so taken; for only that amount would 
be useful for that purpose. 

Thus if land outside the physical limits 
of the principal improvement is taken for 
purposes claimed to be incidental to and 
thus a part of it, the question arises whether 
it is really incidental. The taking of land 
in this way, in addition to the amount 
needed for the primary purpose, has been 
called— somewhat 
condemnation.” 

Let us take as an illustration the laying 
out of a new street and the possible taking 
of land on each side of it, outside the pro- 
posed street lines. For what reasons would 
the city planner wish to take this extra 
land? Would such taking be so related to 
the construction of the street as to be a 
taking for street use? If so, this land may 
be taken by eminent domain. 

Excess condemnation is most often urged 
either in case of a new business street cut, 
or an old one widened, through a low class 
development in the center of the city, or of 
a boulevard in the outskirts through unim 
proved land. In either case one or more 
of three effects may be expected: 

First, the adjacent land may be raised 
in value. May not, in this event, the build- 


unfortunately —“‘excess 





AMERICAN CITY 


ing of the street and the taking of the 
extra land to sell again in order to help pay 
for the street be regarded as one business 
enterprise? The courts of this country are 
inclined to think not. There are decisions 
stating that the extra taking and resale are 
a separate real estate transaction, and there- 
fore not a taking for a public use. 

Secondly, the cutting of the new street 
may leave remnants of lots on each side of 
it not large enough for independent im- 
provement, which shut off the land imme- 
diately back of it from the street and from 
the possibility of improvement in connec- 
tion with the street. If building on the 
street be delayed until private initiative 
unites land ownership in these cases, the 
delay will be a long one. The result will be 
that the city will lose much in taxes, and 
the new street, by reason of its ugly ap- 
pearance for so many years, be given per- 
haps a character that will permanently im- 
pair its usefulness and lower values on it. 
On this second ground the courts seem in- 
clined to uphold excess condemnation. 

A third effect may be that the use of the 
adjacent land, even if not cut into rem- 
nants, may lessen the usefulness of the prin- 
cipal improvement. A boulevard with cheap 
houses bordering it is no longer the beau- 
tiful boulevard that the city spent its money 
to create; a view which the boulevard was 
planned to exhibit to those using it may be 
spoiled by a solid row of tall buildings, or 
by buildings at wrong points. If the adja- 
cent land were taken wherever necessary 
and resold with covenants against such uses 
of it, it would seem as if, without question, 
the boulevard was improved for the pur- 
poses for which it was built. A court deci- 
sion recently rendered holds that taking for 
such a purpose is not constitutional; but it 
is too early to decide whether the decision 
will be generally followed in other states 
and by the Supreme Court of the United 
States. Indeed, the entire law on the sub- 
ject of excess condemnation in this coun- 
try must be regarded as still unsettled. 

So far, we have been discussing excess 
condemnation in connection with the con- 
struction of highways. It may equally well 
be used in connection with other public 
works. The construction of a new public 
building of any pretension tends to raise the 
neighboring land values. It is also impor- 


tant, in order that its esthetic effect may not 
be injured, to control the development of 











THE AMERICAN CITY 


neighboring real estate. Excess condemna- 
tion may be useful in the same ways in con- 
nection with the laying out of new parks. 

We have seen that by excess condemna- 
tion the city may take the entire title of land 
adjacent to an improvement and resell it, 
retaining only certain rights or easements 
in it. This is an indirect way of doing what 
may be done directly. The city may with 
out question take, by making due payment, 
the easement it needs, leaving all the other 
rights in the original owner undisturbed. 
Thus, the city may condemn the right to 
tunnel for subway purposes under real es- 
tate, or control the architecture of private 
buildings near a public building, so that the 
appearance of the public building may not 
be injured. The only condition in this, as 
in all cases of eminent domain, is that the 
taking be for a public use. 

Whatever doubt there may be of the ad- 
vantage and legality of excess condemna 
tion on other grounds, as a remedy for the 
disadvantages of remnants there can be 
none. There has as yet been no complete, 
honest analysis of the financial results of 
excess acquisition. There is reason to be- 
lieve that they are less brilliant than advo- 
cates have led us to suppose. In any event, 
there are other methods of appropriating 
any unearned gain to neighboring land. 
The easements in neighboring land neces- 
sary to protect the principal improvement 
may, as we have just seen, be obtained by 
the city by direct condemnation. The evil 
of the remnant can be cured by excess con- 
demnation alone. 


Condemnation for General Public Purposes 

In referring to the necessity of condemn- 
ing property for a public use, we have 
treated the question as if the use must be 
one known and stated at the time of the 
taking. Such seems to be the universal 
practice in this country. There would be 
a certain advantage to the city, however, 
in taking a supply of land in advance suf- 
ficient and suitable for any of the public 
uses of a growing city. The city cannot 
well decide in advance whether a given 
tract in a part of the city not yet built will 
be useful for a school or an engine house 
or a small open square; but may well be 
certain that land for some purpose will be 
needed, and that it can be selected more 
advantageously and bought more cheaply 
in advance. The city also may often shape 


475 


its planning to suit land that it has thus 
bought. The land until needed could be 
rented, often on very long leases, thus pay 
ing carrying charges. 


Financial Restrictions 

lhe landowner is especially interested in 
the financial side of the laying out and con 
struction of streets and other public fea 
tures of the city. Such improvements ar« 
partly paid for out of taxation and the pro 
ceeds of bond issues. The value of land is 
materially affected by the tax rate and by 
the amount of indebtedness of the city, th 
county and the state. Usually a part, at 
least, of the cost of streets and other im- 
provements is charged to the land in its 
neighborhood on the ground that this land 
is especially benefited. This is a practice 
which differs widely in different states and 
countries, and is also of vital importance to 
landowners. 


Replanning— Street Widening 

In the planning of a city, changes in the 
parts already planned are sometimes neces 
sary. The most common of these changes 
are street widening, the changed use of 
streets, and the renovation of slums. 

A street is usually widened by condemn- 
ing, by methods already described, a strip 
of private property on one or both sides of 
it. This is almost invariably very expen- 
sive, for where street widening is neces- 
sary, values are likely to be high and the 
land already covered with expensive build- 
ings. There is one method of street widen- 
ing which avoids much of the expense « 
taking and tearing down buildings—that « 
the use of the building line, already men 
tioned in another connection 

In order eventually to widen the street, 
the building line is established back of the 
facades of the buildings on the 
Thereafter, the cwner of a building, any 
part of which is in front of the building 
line, may use it as before, but cannot recon 
struct, alter, or substantially repair that 
part of it. He may, however, make minor 
repairs and changes. 

The establishment of the building line 
does not deprive the owner of the building 
of his title to any part of it, but only of th 
right to alter, reconstruct or substantially 
repair a part of it. This right the city 
must, of course, pay for; but the payment 
will be relatively small, for the land is not

to think that our courts would recognize 
the taking of congested land for replan-

the greater portion being rural in character. 

Prior to annexation, however, following 
the old custom, the County Commissioners 
had laid down a street plan over this area, 
and the northwest corners of street inter- 
sections were marked on the ground by 


stone monuments hese streets, as might 


be surmised, were of the rectangular systet

far from satisfactory, and inasmuch as set

topographical survey on which to base plans 
for a sewerage system in the Annex as well 
as in the old city, it was deemed well, befor« 
officially adopting the County Commission

Should Legislation Always Precede City

in fact, we should all feel indebted to him 
for calling attention so forcibly to what the

is not always practicable thus to obtain, in 
advance of the interest of the people, legis 
lation that would be so desirable. We can 
not enact laws and afterwards get the peo 
ple interested. We must, very often, arouse 
public interest and create public demand 
before a legislature will give powers and 
delegate authority. 

loward the creation of this public inter- 
terest and demand, especially with refer 
ence to financial measures, the very prepa 
ration of plans may contribute much. A 
group of citizens who have been unmoved 
by appeals for the endorsement of measures 
designed to facilitate the financing of some 
plan that is yet to be made, may become 
eagerly enthusiastic in behalf of a concrete 
scheme definitely presented. Through the 
necessity of adopting such an order of pro- 
cedure, some plans, or parts of plans, may, 
as Mr. Adams says, be sometimes blocked; 
but with the broadening powers of our 


cities, it is doubtful if many plans fail

rhe service started in the Far West, though 
the word “jitney” seems to be derived ‘rom 
the Southern negro hack driver's “Git 
me, boss.” Now jitneys literally swarm in 
many cities. Within a month 300 of them 
appeared on the streets of San Francisco, 
and soon 1,000 cars were in use there. 
Within a month after the first appearance 
of the jitney in Philadelphia the headlines 
of the Public Ledger announced that on a 
Saturday night North Broad Street was 
“black with jitneys.” A letter to the author 
from the Secretary of the Mayor of Mil 
waukee, under date of April 10, 1915, states 
that “jitney busses have been operated her« 
for only about a month, and we now havs 
about 350 busses in operation.” Dallas re 
ports (May 16) 500 jitneys. A single as- 
sociation in Seattle operates 300 busses. 
Omaha has at the present time ten different 
jitney routes, while Kansas City some time 
ago boasted twenty-seven routes, including 
an owl service up until midnight. From 50 
to 70 jitneys are carrying 4,000 people daily 
in Des Moines. Ogden, Vancouver, Port- 
land, Oakland, St. Louis, Joplin and Balti 
more are but a few of the other cities where 
the jitney is in operation. The Public Util- 
ities Commission of Illinois has issued two 
Certificates of Convenience and Necessity 
for motor bus lines in the city of Chicago 
and has (April 12) another application 
pending before it. 

What does this new business mean to the 
city’s welfare? What is its effect on the 
street railway business? What is its rela- 
tion to road building and maintenance? 
What are the provisions that have been and 
should be adopted for its regulation? 

Allied to, but to be distinguished from, 
the jitney is the large motor bus which has 
developed with such marked rapidity in 
English and European cities. London, 


which boasts “the best paved streets in the 


world” and with its large population, is pe 
culiarly a motor bus city. The Europea 
bus, if single-decked, carries from 20 to 34 
passengers, and if double-decked from 

to 60; they are usually constructed to carry 
a load of three tons. In this country Ne 
York City and Los Angeles on either oceat 
are familiar with motor bus operation, whil 
throughout the Middle West th large 
busses, carrying 30 to 32 passengers, are 
referred to as “jitney boats,” “Lizzies” o1 
*“Jitney-Lizzies.” This happy westert 
phraseology aptly expresses the differences 
between the jitney proper and the large 
motor bus. 


Advantages and Disadvantages 
Numerous advantages to the operator 
the rider and the city are claimed for motor 


vehicles as a means for city transit. They 
make better speed, often considerably bette 
speed. “In London they compete fairly 
well with the rapid transit tubes .. . ex 


cept for long distance travel.” * They ar: 
not confined to the tracks. A break-down is 
limited to a single unit, and does not tie up 
all traffic on a given route as with street 
cars. Moreover, arrangements have been 
made for the transfer of passengers from 
the injured motor to others on the sam 
route, to the definite saving of the passet 
ger’s time. Motor vehicles can draw up to 
the curb, to the safety and convenience of 
the passenger. They are not so noisy as 
street cars, and hence in keeping with th 
modern tendency to eliminate needless 
noises, to the joy of city nerves. Their ex 
tended use joins with the need of other 
motor vehicular trade for improvement i 
the style of pavings on at least stated 
streets. In England thev have long been 
used—and in this country promise to ly 
used with special effectiveness—in develop

ing outlying traffic, as a single bus or a few 
of them can be run at a cost far below the 
costs incident to building and operating an 
electric railway. Birmingham, England, has 
recently bought some thirty omnibuses, in 
cluding garage and plant, from a private 
company for $165,000. Both the city and 
the company will run busses from points 
within to points without the city, but neither 
is to pick up any but their own passengers 
within the limits of the other's activities 
Many an outlying suburb can secure rapid 
and comfortable transit through the motor 
heretofore denied to it through prohibitive 
costs. Thus a number of jitneys now run 
ning between Philadelphia and the nearby 
borough of Lansdowne connect with the 
Philadelphia street railways. English sub 
urbs testify that the motor bus has 
brought enormous increase of population 
within their limits; empty houses have “hb 
come tenanted, effecting a great saving in 
the rates in regard to empties.” The motor 
bus has been in use in England long enough 
to show definite results and costs, hence the 
references to English usages and costs 
throughout this article. 

The manager of the municipal street rail- 
ways in Manchester, England, in a recent 
special report on the passenger transporta 
tion problem of that city, discusses the rela 
tive merits of the motor bus and the tram 
way and concludes that: 

“In Manchester and the surrounding dis 
tricts motor busses will in the future form an 
important part of the surface-transit facili 
ties; they will supplement the tramway set 
vices in many directions, and particularly in 
the outlying and thinly populated districts, 
where the extension of the tramway system 
is rendered financially impossible owing to the 
heavy outlay in permanent-way construction 
There are other directions IT have in mind 
where motor busses, operated in conjunction 
with the tramway service, will enable us to 
afford greater facilities for the traveling 
public.” 

He does not conclude that the bus will 
ever be a substitute for the street railway 

Properly planned motor vehicular transit 
can be made to relieve congestion in the 
city streets, as through motor traffic can 
take designated outlying routes. Absence 
of rails and electric equipment in the streets 
is to the further advantage of the city. The 
service is elastic as to routes and can be 
used to develop special service to conven- 
tion halls, parks, etc. The motor vehicle 
is peculiarly suited to seasonable traf- 


fic, as, for instance, in pleasure resorts and 
to pleasure parks. It can be used particu- 
larly for train service and for public 
schools; a series of such routes, operated 
for short hours, can usually be organized 
that will make up a day’s traffic. It is a 
good means for experimenting with new 
routes. It can give to urban workers ac- 
cess to outlying factories, though the traffic 
be limited to one hour or so in mornings 
and afternoons. It will be one of the most 
effective forces in the needed decentraliza- 
tion of cities. Probably it can be used to 
supplement effectively existing traffic. Thus 
out of petitions for fifty motor bus routes 
for New York City, aggregating more than 
150 miles, the Bureau of Franchises of that 
city recommended to the Board of Estimate 
and Apportionment the adoption of about 
ten routes connecting the residential sec- 
tion “on the east and west side of Central 
Park with what may be termed the hotel, 
theater, wholesale and retail districts, con 
taining also the terminal railway stations 
of the Pennsylvania and Long Island Rail- 
roads.” Certain cross-town lines are also 
selected on streets best adapted to motor bus 
operation. 

The alleged disadvantages of the motor 
vehicle, particularly the jitney, are four: 

1. They may seriously affect the incomes 
of street railways; of this more will be said 
later. 

2. The number of accidents are larger 
than on street railway traffic. This is due 
to two facts: drivers may as yet be inex- 
perienced, and no adequate safety fender 
has as yet been put into use. Safety fen- 
ders on street railways in one city known 
to the author save the lives of 98 per cent 
of the persons, mostly children, knocked 
down by street cars. 

3. It is alleged that “crooks” can use the 
jitney service better than the street railway 
service. Too much has been made of this 
in the public prints, as the danger is but 
little, if any, greater than in any other 
means of transit. 

4. The fourth disadvantage is its higher 
comparative cost, especially for long hauls. 


Effect on Existtng Street Railways 
The questions as to whether the jitney 
will be permanent and the extent of its in- 
roads on existing street railway incomes in- 
volves the important consideration of cost.

Research points out, must be added others 
if the business is to remain on a permanent 
basis. These other expenses are: 
“Insurance of all kinds, including injuries 
and damages, $200 per year; cleaning, inspec- 
tion and housing, 30 cents per day, say $100 
per year; wages of driver, a minimum of $2 
per day, or $700 per year; superintendence and 
management, 75 cents per mile, or on the 
basis of 75 miles per day for 350 days per 
year, $195 per car per year. This latter figure 
is based on the expenses of supervision of one 
of the largest taxicab companies and probably 
could not be equaled by a company operating 
less than 300 cars. The above operating ex- 
penses may be summarized as 5.8 cents per car 
mile plus $1,195 per year.” To these “must be 
added $240 interest and depreciation, and for 
want of better information, $5 each car for 
state registration, personal property tax and 
public vehicle license. The total then is 
$1,450 per year plus 5.8 cents per car mile 
This includes an 8 per cent return on invest-

The running costs per car mile for four

sufficient explanation for the fact that in 
England alone fifty public authorities now 
operate or have power to operate these 
vehicles, and that in London 552,000,000 
passengers were carried by busses so long 
ago as 1912, as compared with 800,000,000 
by tramways. The bus, too, has evidently 


come to stay.

In planning or thinking through the city’s 

it needs, one fact should be kept firmly 
in mind, and that is that the riding habit 
grows more rapidly than does the popula- 
tion. This is graphically shown in the ac- 
companying diagrams comparing the in 


trans 


crease in the number of passengers carried 
with the increase in population over stated 
periods in Manchester and District, and 
(;reater London, England, and in Greater 
New York and Boston. 

Considering (a) the cost factors as given 
thove, (b) the number of new avenues 
that will be opened up by both the jitneys 

| the larger busses, (c) the fact that 
each type of transit tends to develop its 
own customers, (d) that the jitney probably 
picks up many pedestrians who would not 
otherwise use the street car, and (e) that 
the “riding habit” tends to increase more 
rapidly than the population, it is seen that 
the jitneys will probably not seriously dis 
turb the existi g business of street railway 
companies, while they can be used to de- 
velop new business and to give the cities 
more elastic and more rapid transit facili- 
ties. That the bus will never supplant the 
street railway, within a reasonable time at 
least, is further shown by such facts as the 
following: On a given route in Manchester, 
england, the tram car service is now one 
car in every 40 seconds. If motor busses 
were adopted in lieu of tram cars, a 20 
second service would be required to meet 
the same demand; and if only the inside 
seats of the busses were occupied, as they 
would be during inclement weather, the 
necessary service would be one bus every 
ten seconds—a prohibitive string of busses 
from any practical point of view. It can- 
not be alleged that the fact that motor 
busses can load and unload in less time 
than street cars vitiates the above prin 
ciple, as the most of the cars on this route 
contain through passengers and there is 
very little unloading until the city center is 
reached. 

So far as can now be foreseen, then, 
motor vehicular traffic under existing costs 
will not supplant, but will be supplementary 
to, existing plans, or used in new areas in 
lieu of other transit facilities, and will be 
effective in developing new business and in 
giving cities with street railways more elas- 
tic and, to certain sections, more direct and 
more rapid transit facilities.

486 THE AMERICAN CITY 


Effect on City Streets and Country Roads 


Of vital importance to the public welfare 
is the effect of extended motor vehicular 
traffic on the costs of building and main- 
taining city streets and country roads. As 
the motor vehicles will, without doubt, very 
largely supplant the horse-drawn vehicles 
in cities, this whole question must be an in 
creasing and vital problem in every city. 
lhe jitney movement will be of untold pub- 
lic value if it will focus public attention 
upon the need for special types of roads 
for motor trafhec—a boon not only to auto- 
mobilists but to business and trucking fa 
cilities as well. 

Many insidious efforts have been made, 
not only in this country, but in England 
and in other European countries as well, to 
show that the motor vehicles are solely 
responsible for the wear and tear of streets, 
and that they alone should pay all the ex 
penses of their building and upkeep. Thus 
if the levy of 34d. per car mile were made 
on motor busses, as was proposed in Eng 
land, the motor busses would pay, in the 
Westminster area alone, practically $20,000 
per year for road maintenance, whereas 
the total cost of the maintenance of all the 
roads in that area has been estimated to be 
only $14,000 per year. No more effective 
measure could be taken to inhibit either 
actual or potential motor competition with 
street railways than exorbitant levies for 
street and road maintenance and operation. 
The centralized publicity and advertising 
powers of street railways, however, are 
here met by the publicity and advertising 
powers of the automobile interests. 

In planning the city’s streets and roads, 
the truck and the heavy as well as the light 
passenger car must be considered. Certain 
classes of paving are unable to properly 
satisfy the requirements, not only of the 
heavier motor traffic, but of any class of 
trafic when it becomes even moderately 
heavy. The author does not mean to imply 
that motor busses and jitneys should not 
hear their due share of road costs and 
maintenance. This tax, however, should be 
levied as well upon other motor and vehic- 
ular traffic and might well be based on ton- 
nage and on frequency of use. One Eng- 
lish proposal is to charge the motor bus 
companies with the “extra expense” inci- 
dent to such traffic. This “extra expense” 


is interpreted to mean “the amount by 
which the actual cost of repairing the route 
shall exceed what the cost of repairing 
such a route would be, assuming the same 
to have been properly maintained up to the 
standard required by the ordinary traffic 
thereon.” For this purpose motor bus own- 
ers, whether public or private, were to be 
required to keep daily records showing the 
routes traversed, the number of journeys, 
the mileage, tonnage and other items of im- 
portance. English cities, too, are demand 
ing that the motor bus pay a proportional 
part of the cost of widening streets or roads 
in order that they may be adapted to motor 
trafhe. The reasonableness of proper pay- 
ments for road maintenance based on ac- 
tual usage cannot be questioned. Even if 
publicly owned and operated for “social 
welfare,” this item should still be included 
in operating costs of transit systems, in or- 
der that the taxpayer may know just what 
such transit is costing him. 


Regulation 


rhat the jitney and the motor bus should 
regulated goes without saying. As a 
minimum, permits should be required,’ 
routes* and fares* specified, and minimum 
provisions for public safety* and conven- 
5 ; 
ience* enforced. Chauffeurs should pass

have been long in use. 


* Thus the San Francisco ordinance very properly 
makes it unlawful to drive over any other route or to 
different termini or on a different schedule from that 
prescribed in the permit. It is also unlawful to ne 
glect to operate. In Los Angeles the route may be 
changed on approval—approval requiring a fee of 50 
cents: and a sign on the lower wind shield must state 
the fare, route and termini—exemplary provisions both.

ly local, there is special reason for local 


scrutiny of expenditures and operation 
costs. This need not apply, to be sure, 
where services are inter-urban,  inter-

where the 


inter-township. In England, 
conflict local 
and state centralization is as definite as in 
the United States, the local authorities have 
persistently insisted on keeping bus receipts 


between control 


and control under their own supervision. 
Ihe franchise term should be definitely 
limited. There are special reasons for this: 
the insecurity of the future, the heavy risks, 
the possibilities of future dey elopment, the 
unascertainable competitive effects on 
street railways and other means of urban 
transit, and the fact that no heavy initial 
investments in tracks or permanent road 
way are required. A period of fifteen years 
could well be the maximum franchise term, 
as was recommended by the Franchise Bu 
reau of New York ( ity. Police regulation 
should be provided for, though purely from 
the traffic standpoint only. Proper and ef- 


ficient mudguards and, if possible, efficient 
safety fenders should be required. The 
traffic may well be limited to designated 


roads of proper stability and character. 
The question of the tax” will be a dif- 
ficult one, as automobilists are already pay 


ing a considerable tax into most state 
treasuries. In England a heavy petrol 
(gasoline) tax is paid. A tax on gross 


receipts would be better than a tax on units 
found with 
street railways, tends to limit the number of 
cars in service. Every effort will be made 
in the interest of street railways to have a 
tax so high as to be prohibitive. Thus in 
Pennsylvania a tax of 10 per cent has al- 
ready been proposed by a state legislator.

$75 per year for a car of five passengers, $100 for

$10 per year for five persons or less, $20 for five to

It would seem but fair that the major por- 
tion of the tax returns should properly go 
to the local road authorities. 

lransfer provisions should be required 
when possible, and special provisions should 
allow the driver to leave the roads named at 
stated hours for stated purposes. Thus the 
ordinance in Oakland provides that persons 
holding motor licenses may leave their pre 
scribed routes to 
“carry passengers to and from: (1) public 
schools on days when the same are in ses- 
sion and before the opening and after the 
closing thereof on such days; (2) railroad 
stations prior to arrival and departure of ex- 
cursion trains for the purpose of delivering 
passengers to and taking them from such ex- 
cursion train: (3) on any occasion of public 
assemblage to and from public parks, churches, 
theatres; (4) to and from all other places of 
public assemblage during the continuance 
thereof and during a period not to exceed 
one hour before and one hour after the time 
of the commencement and conclusion of any 
such assemblage.” 
This allows for the elasticity of traffic, 
which is a vital characteristic of motor 
transit. And, finally, every American city 
must sooner or later, if it is to have ade- 
quate transit policies, put all the means of 
transit under single control. This points 
to the need of utility bureaus with such 
special divisions as the problems and ex- 
penditures of the various cities require.” 

The relationship between transit and ur- 
ban welfare, between business development 
and rapid transit, between a facile transit 
system and manufacturing development in 
outlying portions where land is cheap, and 
between the jitney and street railway in- 
comes, is so intimate that motor franchises 
should, as in other utilities, uniformly in- 
clude the right of the city to own and op- 
erate at any time. Chicago already has a 
proposal for investing three million dollars 
in publicly owned and operated motor bus 
lines. So vital is transit to municipal de- 
velopment that Berlin, according to the 
press dispatches under date of April 10, 
1915, has, despite war pressure, unanimous- 
ly appropriated $32,500,000 for public own- 
ership and operation of cheap transit sys- 
tems and to provide for cheap electricity. 
American cities will do well at this time 
to give special consideration to their pres- 
ent and future transit plans.

Assessing Cost of Extensions in a Municipally- 


Owned Water-Works Plant 


MONG the interesting features of 
“Superintendent’s Day” at the Cin- 
cinnati convention of the American 

Water-Works Association last month, was 
the paper by D. A. Reed, manager of the 
Water and Light Department of the city of 
Duluth, Minn., and the discussion which fol 
lowed it. In his paper Mr. Reed emphasized 
the fact that the logical method of assessing 
the cost of any improvement, the product 
of any utility, or the benefits from any ser- 
vice rendered, is upon the interests directly 
benefited. He also assumed, as an axiom, 
that a municipal plant should be sel f-sustain- 
ing in every sense of the word ;—“it should 
neither give nor receive any benefit or con- 
sideration of any kind from the taxpayer, 
the city or the individual.” 

With these ideals in mind, it may be taken 
for granted that the entire cost of a water 
main of minimum size should be assessed 
against the property directly abutting. The 
difficult problem to determine is how to dis- 
tribute the cost in the case of larger mains. 
The practice in Mr. Reed's own city was 
outlined by him as follows: 


“The method employed at Duluth, Minn., in 
which a gas utility is also operated in connec- 
tion with the water system, the pipes being 
laid in the same trench, has been to assess 
annually for 15 years against the abutting 
property 8 per cent of the total cost of each 
extension as represented by a 4-inch gas and 
a 6-inch water main; it having been established 
that sizes in excess of these dimensions would 
be for the strengthening of the system to 
benefit other customers outside of those 
served by that particular extension. The pro- 
portion of charges against the abutting prop- 
erty has been based upon 5 per cent for in- 
terest and 3 per cent for sinking fund each 
year for the 15-year period. A 3 per cent con- 
tribution to a 4 per cent sinking fund, how- 
ever, will not retire the principal short of 
22 years; but for various reasons it has been 
considered advisable to limit the duration of 
annual asse sements to a 15-year term. A spe- 
cial discount of 25 per cent is allowed to those 
paying the total amount in one payment. 

“These assessments are made according to 
the frontage of the lot, without reference to 
its depth. However, the frontage of the lot is 
not considered necessarily as being the side 
abutting the street upon which the extension 
is made. It may lie parallel to the mains, and 


front on another street. It is assessed the 
same as other lots of the same frontage di 


mension Subsequently, if mains are laid +e 
front of the short side, no assessment is mad 
therefor on this particular lot—which can, of 
course, receive no benefit from a second ex 


tension 

‘Against this assessment is credited one 
half of the water and one-third of the gas 
rates paid by the occupant of the premises 
it being estimated that these proportions are 
necessary factors in a rate that will yield the 
proper amount of revenues for maintaining 
and operating the plant.” 


Mr. Reed summarized principles and re¢ 
sults involved in the methods outlined by him 
as follows: 


“1 All charges, whether of installation or 
of operation, against property or a customer 
are based upon actual cost. 

“2. Costs of distributing systems are ordi 
narily borne by abutting property, except when 
the consumption is sufficiently large to assume 
the whole or part of this expense, in whicl 
case the charge is gradually transferred to the 
customer. 

“3. The customer bears operating costs and 
such installation charges as cover reservoirs 
pumping machinery. stations, intakes and thi 
larger distributing mains 

“4. As the municipal plant increases in si 
and in the amount of its revenues, its pet 
centage of indebtedness will gradually de- 
crease; the proportion of interest and sinking 
fund in the rates charged for water will de 
crease; until eventually, when no indebtedness 
exists, this factor will hecome zero and there 
will be no credits against the assessments 
They will have to be met in full annual 
payments, or the consumer may discount the 
entire amount of his individual assessment by 
paying cash, taking advantage of the twenty 
five per cent discount 

The percentage plan enables the small 
property owner who is a consumer to obtain 
extensions on very easy terms, with practi- 
cally no additional expense over and above 
the regular water rates. ‘ 

“It seems to be a practicable way for 
real estate owners to secure extensions t 
gas and water service in newly platted addi 
tions, without throwing any of the burdet 
upon the utility or its customers 

“>. It furnishes a profitable investment at 
& per cent net for the sinking funds of the 
department until the time arrives when it will 
be needed to retire bonds; at which time, if 
the money or any portion of it cannot be with- 
drawn, refunding bonds or new bonds in whole 
or in part may be issued. Eventually, if the

rates for service have been correctly estab- 
lished, the time will be reached when its en- 
tire indebtedness will be retired. This will 
be true if depreciation and maintenance have 
been provided for in the operating expenses, 
as well as interest and sinking fund on the 
indebtedness.” 


Practice in Other Cities 


From the stenographic report of the dis- 
cussion, the following excerpts are taken: 


Wirt J. Wills, Memphis, Tenn.—“In Mem- 
phis the Water Board lays 100-foot extensions 
to the houses. Should a_ sub-division be 
opened up without any houses on it, the 
owners of the sub-division have to take ad- 
vantage of what we call the ‘water-note plan,’ 
which is a note made up like any other note, 
but reading ‘payable in rentals from water, 
without interest, $.......’ For instance, the 
man that gives this note advances the money 
and all of the revenues from that line are 
credited up to him until the entire cost of 
the main has been returned to him. In that 
way mains have been installed in perhaps 40 
per cent of the resident district of Memphis, 
and a great many of them are already paid for. 
Of course, the man who advances the money 
takes all the risk of the scheme. If we put 
down a main for a sub-division which is not 
developed properly, and which is perhaps sold 
for a brick-yard, all the burden then comes on 
the owner of the sub-division.” 


A. A. Reimer, East Orange, N.. J—“We 
adopted a somewhat different plan, by which 
any person wishing an extension in a newly 
developed property or a property that was on 
the map to be developed, would have to guar- 
antee us a certain revenue. We were willing 
“4 pay the money for the work and capitalize 
it, of course, but we wanted to see a guarantee 
of a certain revenue that would meet a given 
percentage of the cost before we were willing 
to go ahead with the work. The result of that 
has been to prevent a great many wild-cat 
schemes, and to-day an operator who wants to 


develop truck land counts his cost before he 
goes into it instead of having the city pay all 
the bills.” 

Theodore A. Leisen, Detroit, Mich.—‘In 
Detroit for some years now the policy has been 
to make extensions wherever buildings are 
going up, on what is termed a ‘bonus’ plan, 
the estimated cost of the pipe line being fig- 
ured out, and a bonus of 15 per cent is charged, 
supposed to be based on 5 per cent interest on 
the investment for three years, with the ex- 
pectation that at the end of three years there 
will be enough built-up property to make it a 
paying proposition ; then the consumer is 
credited with whatever revenue may be de- 
rived from the water-supply that is provided 
for the property at that time. The revenue 
that is thus credited is deducted from the 
15 per cent, the difference being the bonus 
which the property owner has to pay. This 
plan is to prevent the laying in some cases of 
150 feet of pipe when not one single house 
was going up along the street where the main 
would be required.” 

Francis C. Hersey, Jr., Wellesley, Mass.— 
“We had a case in Wellesley of a piece of 
property embracing about sixteen or seven- 
teen vacant lots. We estimated it would cost 
us $4,000 to lay a 6-inch main into this prop- 
erty. We got a bond from the promoters in 
the amount of $4,000 that they would take that 
amount of water within the succeeding five 
years, and that each year of those five years 
they would pay us 20 per cent of the amount. 
Of course, they could use that much water, 
but if they did not use it, they would have to 
pay the difference. At the end of five years 
that thing went to pieces.” 


A. A. Reimer, East Orange, N. J.—‘I think 
we have to be very careful if we adopt any of 
these plans, to see that we protect our city or 
our company, in case it is a private company, 
so that the time will not come when a heavy 
investment literally sinks into the ground and 
leaves a hole in our finances. Even if we 
get rentals for five years, we are out the water, 
anyway.” 





Make the Fourth of July, 1915, 
“Americanization Day” 


HE Immigrants in America Review is 
sending out a patriotic call to all citi- 
zens, American born and foreign 

born alike, to make the Fourth of July 
Americanization Day, and to get together 
as one nation and one people for America, 
in peace or war. We believe that all races 
in this country are first for America, but 
that we need to know and understand each 


other better. If American ideals and pur- 
poses and opportunities are to be fully real- 
ized, the barriers that separate the newly 
naturalized citizen from the native born 
must be swept aside. 

The Review therefore offers a prize of 
$250 for the best article on “What America 
Means and How to Americanize the Immi- 
grant,” with a program for a Fourth of July 

















THE AMER 


celebration especially designed to welcome 
recently naturalized citizens and alien resi 
dents. 

A Letter to Mayors 

Frederic C. Howe, Commissioner of Im- 
migration at Ellis Island, has addressed the 
following letter to the mayors of American 
cities: 

U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 

Immigration Service 
Office of 
Commissioner of Immigration 
Ellis Island, New York Harbor, N. Y. 
May 22, IQI5. 

My Dear Sir—You may be interested in 
learning of a most significant civic demonstra- 
tion that may be of value to you in connection 
with the Fourth of July celebration in your 
city. I refer to the “Citizenship Receptions,” 
or “New Voters’ Day,” which the cities of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore and Los 
Angeles have recently held as a final step in 
the naturalization of foreign-born aliens. 

Each year large numbers of aliens are ad- 
mitted to citizenship. The procedure is for 
the most part informal, and is attended with 
no recognition on the part of the community 
of its significance to America and to the alien 
The purpose of the reception is to give dignity 
to the ceremony and at the same time impress 
its meaning upon all citizens. 

The idea arose in Cleveland in 1914, when 
the “Sane Fourth Committee” assumed the 
responsibility for a program arranged by a 
committee representing all local patriotic and 
civic organizations. Through the clerks of 
naturalization, the names and addresses of 
aliens admitted to citizenship during the pre- 
ceding year were secured, and invitations for 
the reception were sent to each. At the recep- 
tion, each new citizen on entering the audi- 
torium and showing his ticket, was presented 
with a small American flag and also a seal 
button of the city with the word “Citizen” up- 
on it. A platform decorated with the flags 
of all nations was reserved to seat the new 
citizens. The audience itself was secured by 
general publicity through the newspapers, 
which gladly gave publicity to the idea. The 
program opened with national airs. This was 
followed with the unfurling of a large Amer- 
ican flag, the “Star Spangled Banner” being 
sung and the “Pledge of Allegiance” being re- 
cited in unison. Officials representing the na- 
tion, state and city made addresses, followed 
by a speech of appreciation by one of the 
prominent foreign-born citizens. 

The significance of such a reception given 
on the Fourth of July is obvious. Should they 
become national in scope, they should have

great civic value. I am sending you this in- 
formation with the thought that vou may de- 
sire to appoint a Mayor's Committee for the 
organization of such a reception in your city 
in connection with whatever exercise may be 
held on the Fourth of July. 

There will be a “National Americanization 
Day Committee” which will furnish informa 
tion and answer inquiries. I would appreciate 
having from you an expression of your ideas 
on this subject. 

Very respectfully yours,

A Letter to Foreign-Born Citizens 

Che Editor of the Review, by the codpera- 
tion of the Association of Foreign Language 
Newspapers, has addressed the following 
letter to the foreign-born citizens in Amer 
ica, through the columns of hundreds of 
foreign language papers: 

To Foreign-Born Citizens of America. 

In 1776 the Declaration of Independence set 
this country free and made it a haven for the 
oppressed of many lands who have come here 
seeking opportunity. In 1915, the Declaration 
of Independence is to be interpreted as a new 
Declaration of Citizenship 


We Americans and coming Americans, safe 


in the peace, prosperity and strength of our 
country, seek some way in which to express as 
one people our appreciation of these blessings 
It is, therefore, proposed that on the Fourth 
of July the American-born citizens hold recep 
tions with appropriate exercises in honor of 
our naturalized fellow-citizens and declarants 
On this occasion, we will all seek together to 
make this July the Fourth a day of inspira 
tion and fulfillment to all citizens alike. 

In order to do this, we need your ideas, your 
advice, and your active codperation, and | 


shall be glad to receive your suggestions for 


the National Americanization Day Committee 
(Signed) Frances A. KeELtor, 
Editor, Jmmigrants in America Review. 
The National Americanization Day Com- 
mittee, which is now being organized, wishes 
to aid cities individually by suggesting pro 
grams and speakers and by cooperating in 
every possible way to make Americanization 
Day for newly naturalized citizens a suc 


cess. 

The membership of the committee will be 
announced later. Inquiries should be ad- 
dressed to the National Americanization 
Day Committee, Room 1205, 95 Madison

Akron is a very hilly city, and if it wer

instead of the eight now in operation to

\nother interesting proof of the desira- 
bility of motor-driven apparatus is indicated 
by records showing that about 80 per cent 
of the fires in Akron since the department 
was motorized have been extinguished by 
chemicals. The record in this

fire has to be extinguished with water. This 
record also indicates that in a much larger

was able to reach the scene of the fire in

THE CITY MANAGER PLAN IN 
FORTY-FIVE CITIES 








Editor’s Note 


THe AMERICAN City for some weeks past 


has been endeavoring to gather information 
regarding all the City Managers who are 
now holding office in the United States. On 
the following pages will be found the por- 
traits of twenty-nine of them, with brief 
biographical data. There is also published a 
summary of reports from sixteen other cities 
which have inaugurated the city manager 
idea or have voted to do so. There are thus 
represented in this survey forty-five cities 
—a substantially complete list, it ts believed, 
of the municipalities in the United States 
which have taken definite steps in the adop 
tion of the city manager idea. 

The rapidity with which this new form of 
government is spreading ts indicated by the 
fact that practically all of these forty-five 
cities have adopted the plan within the last 

° The methods by which the city 
manager idea has been instituted may be 
divided roughly into two general groups: 


wo years. 


1. The continuance of an existing charter, 
the City Manager being appointed by virtue 
of an ordinance under which his powers and 
duties are defined; 


> 


2. The adoption of a commission gover 
ment charter, with provision for the appoint 
ment by the commission of a City Manages 
to whom are delegated the non-political ca 
ecutive functions of the municipality 
Of these two mtethods the latter form is 
generally advocated by municipal experts 
and it has come to be known as the Commis 
sion-Manager Plan of municipal govern 
ment, 
The a result « 
this survey has served to emphasize the fact 
that while the city manager idea its a distinct 
step forward in American municipal govern 
ment, it cannot be regarded as a magic pana 
ea for all municipal ills. Under an anti- 
quated charter, an able man may make a fai 
record as City Manager, and under a mod 
ern charter a mediocre manager may meas 
urably but the eminent 
qualifications and the charter of ideal pro 


information secured as 


succeed; man of 
visions must be combined in any city which 
reach its highest type of government 
The commission-manager plan ts the best de 
vice yet developed for attracting able men 
to the study and practice of municipal ad- 
ministration as a possible life work. 


is to 





Essentials of the Commission-Manager Plan 
(as defined by the National Short Ballot Association) 


1. UNIFICATION OF Powers 

All powers of the city to be vested in a 
single group of elective officers, constituting 
a council or commission. 

2. THe Snort BaLLot 

The council to be elected in one of the fol- 
lowing ways: 

(a) At large (if the number of members 
to be chosen at any one time is five or less). 

(b) By wards. 

(c) By proportional representation. 


3. Uniriep EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION 


Non-political executive functions dele- 


gated to an official appointed by the commis- 
sion to serve during their pleasure, to be 
known as the “City Manager” or by other 
appropriate title; position of city manager 
to be open to non-residents; salary of city 
manager to be determined by the council and 
variable from time to time; the city man- 
ager’s executive powers to include appoint 
ment and removal and general control of all 


subordinates, » such 


subject t restrictions 


(e. g., civil service regulation and audit) as 
may be necessary to prevent abuses of power 


without diffusing responsibility

What the City Managers Are Expected to Do 


The following is a summary of the duties 
of city managers as given in the various 
charters or ordinances creating the office of 
City Manager in the municipalities men- 
tioned on the preceding pages. Although 
titles such as General Manager, Business 
Manager, etc., are assigned in some in- 
stances to the individuals officiating in these 
positions, the _,Sommonly known term of 

“City Manager” has been used. Also, in re- 
ferring to the act creating the office, refer- 
ence is made in every case to the Commis- 
sion as the governing body, although a few 
of the city managerships are created by ordi- 
nance of the Board of Trustees of a village 
or of the City Council of a municipality 
which has not adopted the commission form 
of government. 

The City Manager is the administrative head 
of the municipal government under the direc- 
tion and supervision of the Commission. He 
may not hold any other office or employment, 
except that of notary public, nor be interested 
in the profits or emoluments of any contract, 
job, work, or service for the city. 

Before entering upon the duties of his office, 
he is required to take the official oath and to 
execute a bond in favor of the city for the 
faithful performance of his duties in such sum 
as may be fixed hy the Commission. 

He is vested with power to appoint and re- 
move officers and members of all boards and 
commissions, heads of departments, and all 
subordinate officers and employes of the city, 
except as otherwise specified. All officers ap- 
pointed by the City Manager serve until re- 
moved by him or until their successors have 
been appointed and have qualified. 

Most of the charters give very wide 
powers to the City Manager, and in addi- 
tion to enumerating specific duties, some of 
them provide that the City Manager shall 
exercise and perform all other executive 
and administrative functions and duties 
which he deems essential, unless other des- 
ignation shall have been made in the charter 
or by act of the Commission. Specific du- 
ties assigned to the City Manager in various 
charters or ordinances include the follow- 
ing : 

To prepare an annual budget and keep the 
Commission advised of the financial condition 
and future needs of the city. 

To install a complete and practical system 
of municipal accounting, with the proper sys- 
tem of checks between the various depart- 
ments. 

To take active control of the fire, police and 


[508] 


engineering departments of the city, and to 
engage such assistants therein as are provided 
for in the charter or ordinance. 

To see that, within the city, the laws of the 
state and the ordinances, resolutions and by- 
laws of the Commission are enforced and 
faithfully executed; in so doing, to sign war- 
rants and cause arrests when necessary. 

To supervise, under the direction of the 
Commission, the administration of the affairs 
of the city. 

To attend all meetings of the Commission, 
and to recommend to that body from time to 
time such measures as he deems necessary or 
expedient for it to adopt. 

To draw up resolutions and ordinances for 
adoption by the Commission and furnish them 
with any necessary information respecting any 
of the departments under his control. 

To prepare and submit to the Commission 
such reports as may be required by that body, 
and to draw up an annual report which shall 
consolidate the special reports of the several 
departments. 

To revoke licenses, pending the action of 
the Commission. 

To administer oaths and take affidavits. 

To sign such contracts, deeds and other pub- 
lic documents on behalf of the city as the Com- 
mission may authorize and require. 

To manage and control all charitable, cor- 
rectional and reformatory institutions and 
agencies belonging to the city; to enforce all 
laws, ordinances and regulations relative to 
the preservation and promotion of the public 
health, the prevention and restriction of dis- 
ease, the prevention, abatement and suppres- 
sion of nuisances, and the sanitary inspection 
and supervision of the production, transporta- 
tion, storage and sale of food and foodstuffs, 
and the supervision of weights and measures: 
to cause a complete and accurate system of 
vital statistics to be kept, and in times of 
epidemic to enforce such quarantine and iso- 
lation regulations as may be appropriate to the 
emergency. 

To manage and supervise all public i improve- 
ments, works and undertakings of the city 
except as otherwise provided in the charter or 
ordinance, such as the construction, improve- 
ment, repair and maintenance of streets, side- 
walks, alleys, lanes, squares, bridges, viaducts, 
aqueducts, public highways, sewers, drains, 
ditches, culverts, streams and water courses, 
and of all public buildings, including the man- 
agement and control of market houses, crema- 
tories, sewage disposal plants and farms. 

To take charge of the making and preserva- 
tion of all surveys, maps, plans, drawings and 
estimates for the public work above men- 
tioned; to supervise the cleaning, sprinkling 
and lighting of streets and public places, the 
collection and disposal of waste, the preserva- 
tion of tools and appliances belonging to the 
city and pertaining to the functions of the de- 
partments. He is to manage all municipal

He may not appoint any relative of his to 
any oftfce of trust. 

He is required to devote his entire time to 
the duties of his office. 

The City Manager has the exclusive right 
to suspend any ol the officers or employes in 
the respective departments who may be under 
his management and control, for incompetence 
gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, drunk- 
enness, failure to obey orders given by the 
proper authority, or for any other just and 
reasonable cause. If any officer or employe 
is so suspended, the City Manager is required 
to certify the fact to the Commissjon in writ 
ing, giving the cause for the suspension, and 
the Commission then renders judgment there- 
on, which judgment, if the charge be sustained, 
may be suspension, reduction in rank, or dis- 
missal—such judgment in the matter being 
final, except as otherwise provided. The City 
Manager, in any such investigation, has the 
same power to administer oaths and secure the 
attendance of witnesses and the production of 
books and papers as is conferred upon the 
Commission.

The Attempt to Wreck the Dayton Charter 


lo the Editor of THE AMERICAN City: 

The local Dayton Socialist Party will soon 
file a charter amendment petition with the 
This will 
be the second petition filed since January 1. 
The first failed because it did not have the 
required number of legal signatures. There 
is little doubt that the Socialists will obtain 
the required number of signatures to the 
petition now circulating, which is Io per 
cent of the total number of electors, or 
3,239; more than 1,000 have already been 
reported as the result of 30 petitions, with 
145 yet to be heard from. 

The first movement to amend the new city 
charter was made by a disappointed Demo- 
cratic politician, before it had been in oper- 
ation four months. It was abortive, as the 
required number of signatures could not be

necessary to check up the names of the elec- 
tors contained therein, before turning it 
over to the Board of Elections with a re- 
quest to call a special election for submit 
ting the amendments to the people on a ref- 
erendum vote. 

After four weeks’ hard work the City 
Commissioners refused to send the amend- 
ments proposed by the United Trades and 
Labor Council to the people for a referen- 
dum. This action was based on the fact that 
1,558 of the 3,812 signatures upon the peti- 
tion were invalid. 

No charges of fraud were made, the 
Commissioners basing their action upon the 
ground that the signatures upon the petition 
which were in accordance with the require- 
ments of the charter were less in number 
than 10 per cent of the electors of the city. 
Among the defective signatures were found 
711 that were not registered in the precincts 
corresponding to the addresses given; 249 
were thrown out because of irregular and 
faulty affidavits; 164 signed in lead pencil 
when the law expressly states that ink is 
required; while other signatures were dis- 
carded because of insufficient addresses, be- 
cause of duplication, and for other reasons. 

The United Trades and Labor Council, 
after considerable delay, concluded to drop 
the matter. It was felt by many members 
of the unions that their Council was being 
used as a catspaw by scheming politicians 
with the promise that the schemers would 
grant a lot of favors to the members of the 
Labor Council if the movement should suc- 
ceed. A large number of union men be- 
lieve that they are being better treated by 
the present city government than by. any 
previous administration, and, besides, 
deemed it wholly unfair not to give the new 
form of government a longer trial. 

The so-called amendments to the charter 
were, in reality, simply a proposed reversion 
to the old form of government, as they pro- 
vided for the enlargement of the commis- 
sion from five to fifteen, twelve to be elected 
from wards and three at large. This would 
be a step backward, in the face of thorough- 
ly demonstrated progress as shown by the 
results achieved during the first year, not 
the greatest of which was a saving of over 


$33,000 in the City Purchasing Agent’s de 
partment. 

\nother amendment provided for the “di- 
rect election of the city manager, who shall 
act as mayor.” This would also be a bad 
move, as it would combine administrative 
with legislative functions of government, 
which is avoided under the present plan. 
Moreover, it would make it almost impos- 
sible to get a high-grade man, as a man of 
that type would not run for office when he 
would know beforehand that he would be 
responsible to a political boss and not the 
people. This would be sure to be the case 
when another amendment reduced the 
mayor-manager’s salary to $6,000. 

The “direct election of the city solicitor 
with an appropriation of not to exceed 
$5,000 instead of $13,000, as at present al- 
lowed,” was another amendment proposed. 
his was absurd and impossible on the face 
of it, for this office could not possibly be 
run for such a small amount. The adminis- 
tration previous to this spent over $16,000. 

The final amendment provided “that all 
of these officers must be residents of Dayton 
for a period of at least two years preceding 
their election.” This was a direct “knock” 
at the City Manager, who is an outsider and 
therefore persona non grata to the “gang.” 

The movement just about completed by 
the Socialists calls for about the same 
changes as advocated by the Labor Council 
—that is, it is not an amendment but a sub- 
stitution and reversion to the old log-rolling 
type of government. 

While the present charter is not perfect, 
it is fair and just that it should be given 
at least two years’ trial before any attempt 
is made to amend it. That would be the 
wise course, especially when it has operated 
so successfully the first year. There is not 
a single department or division of the pres- 
ent city government that has not shown a 
marked improvement over any previous ad- 
ministration the city ever had.

mect. Meetings are postponed again and 
again because one councilman happens to be 
out of the city, sick, or too busy to attend. 
hus one man may block the city’s affairs 
under the three-men form of city council. 

Sumter depended for years on whiskey 
dispensary revenues of about $20,000 to 
$25,000 annually. When _ the dispensary 
was voted out, the city didn't provide for 
this loss of revenue by extra taxes. There- 
fore the city has been running behind finan- 
cially for several years. 

Just whether Sumter will have another 
city manager I don’t know. Under the 
present form of government the city council 
seems to be remote from the masses of the 
people. There is not adequate publicity of 
the city’s affairs. 1 think the City Council 
ought to meet at regular intervals of, say, 
once a month at least, and the citizens 
should be encouraged to appear before 
council with any requests. I believe, too, 
that city councilmen should take more inter- 
est in the city’s affairs than any other class 
of citizens. They should take the lead in 
matters of bonded indebtedness, street im- 
provements and other public works. 

I was one of the original leaders for com- 
mission government for Sumter. But we 
didn’t get the “simon pure” commission 
government. Even now I am not prejudiced 
against commission government if it really 
is commission government. I believe fur- 
ther that, in cities with sufficient business to 
warrant it, a city manager who is compe- 
tent, and who is given the right amount of 
latitude, can save a lot of money, do away 
with extravagance and “graft” where graft 
exists, and also increase the efficiency of 
the city departments. 

Sumter has not the commission form of 
government as contemplated by the Com- 
mission Government Act of 1912 of the 
South Carolina Legislature. Florence, 
S. C., has such commission government 
without a city manager. 

Sumter’s plan of alleged commission gov- 
ernment eliminates some of the best ele- 
ments of the Commission Government Act. 
For instance, Sumter has no civil service 
commissioners or civil service requirements 
as Florence has for city employes. 

I consider the civil service essential to 
the safety of any form of government. 


AMERICAN 


Case 


Civil service protects the taxpayers and 
protects the city employes, besides increas- 
ing efficiency through the merit system of 
promotion. 

Under Section 20 of the Commission 
(sovernment Act, eliminated by Sumter, the 
Civil Service Commissioners examine by 
physical and mental competitive examina- 
tions all applicants for city subordinate 
positions, and designate a list of eligibles 
for the City Council or Commissioners to 
No city employe may be dis- 
missed without the approval of a majority 
of the Civil Service Commissioners. 

If the City Manager was selected by joint 
selection of a Civil Service Commission 
and City Council, and was not under the 
domination and political control of the City 
Council, the City Manager would not hesi- 
tate to take action, if it became necessary, 
for neglect of duty or any other act of the 
City Council or any of its members. The 
same advantage would be with all subor- 
dinates of the City Council under civil ser- 
vice rules. 

Politics are not eliminated by Sumter’s 
alleged commission government. Under 
the three-men form a political ring is more 
easily formed, because with only three men 
any one man has only to get one more 
councilman with him and the ring is 
formed. This is not so easy with five or 
nine men on city council. 

A City Manager ought to be free to see 
that all laws are obeyed by the City Coun- 
cil as well as by subordinates and citizens.

From a Charter Expert 


To the Editor of Tae American City: 

I have read with great interest Mr. 
Reardon's statement in regard to the Sum- 
ter situation. From what I have been able 
to gather from correspondence, from a 
visit to Sumter and a long conversation 
with Mr. Worthington, the former City 
Manager, I should say that Mr. Reardon's 
comments form a correct analysis of the 
case. 

Perhaps the chief difficulty in Sumter is 
that the modus operandi of the city man- 
ager plan was not thoroughly understood 

















THE AMER 
in the beginning, and consequently was not 
defined in the charter as it should be. I 

for giving the commission complete 
responsibility, but that responsibility should 
be exercised through well-defined

to act collectively only. I understand that 
it has been the practice in Sumter for the 
individual commissioners to assume 


per 
sonal responsibility for various details 
which were properly the sole business of 
the City Manager. 

[ am inclined to agree with Mr. Reardon 
that better off with a 
somewhat larger council, so that individual 
members would not be quite so much in- 
clined to take themselves too seriously. 

| fully agree with Mr. Reardon as to the 


desirability of having employes of the city 


Sumter would be 


elected on a civil service basis. Howe ver, in 
a city as small as Sumter the absence of such 
arrangements should not be an insuperable 
barrier to good government. If the commis- 


sioners play politics and appoint their 
friends to office, it may be simply becaus 
the citizenship of Sumter is not alive to th 
insidious evil lurking in that sort of thing. 
One remedy, therefore, is a better informed 
and more sensitive public. It has been well 
said many a time that the people of a com 
munity better government

style of government a good many cities got

worse than they deserved. In the long run 
the best that the city-manager plan will do 
will be to see that the people get what is 
coming to them. 

But I do not believe that all of the dif- 
ficulty in Sumter is due to civic conditions. 
It is undoubtedly partly due to the defective 
mechanism of the charter, as | 
cated above. 


have indi- 
Let me repeat that Sumter will 
never get the good out of the plan of gov- 
ernment until the charter itself and the citi 
zens insist that the elected board of commis- 
sioners confine themselves absolutely to leg- 
islative matters and act not as individuals, 
but as a group. 

Sumter’s experience will probably be du- 
plicated in other cities to some extent. It 
is not easy to change the habits formed 
during generations’ experience under a rad 
ically different form of government. The 
hard knocks that the city manager plan gets 
in the beginning of its career are part of 
the adjusting process. No one need give 


cCAM CITY 


them any anxious thought, but the cities 
which adopt this plan must realize that 
there is a world of experience and kn¢ 


edge ot municipal affairs outside their « 


borders which are easily available and fro 
which they may be able to derive advanc 
which will forestall some of 
the kind of difficulties which have 


with in Sumter.

New Building for the Oakland

OAKLAND, Cal.—The new five-story build- 
ing to be erected by the Oakland Chamber 
of Commerce and Commercial Club, Con- 
solidated, opposite the million dollar Hotel 
Oakland, is designed to meet the require- 
ments of the Club and also to house the 
other commercial and civic organizations 
of the city. The second floor will be de- 
voted to an exhibit of the resources and at- 
tractions of Alameda County. 

The dining and jinx hall for the Club will 
he located on the top floor and will con- 
nect directly with the lounging and billiard 
rooms on the floor below. The business 
offices of the Club will occupy a portion of 
the third floor, the remaining space being 
occupied by other organizations. The first 
floor will be reserved for stores. 

In the basement the Club will have a 
gymnasium, bowling alleys and baths with

Cooperation with School Interests 

Jouier, Ill—An affiliation has been ef- 
fected between the Principals’ Club of the 
Joliet Teachers’ Federation and the Joliet 
\ssociation of Commerce, by which the 
former becomes a bureau of the latter. The 
principals of the twenty-three grade schools 
of Joliet thus become directly identified with 
the Association of Commerce. The new 
plan is expected to prove very beneficial to 
the school interests of the city, and the Joliet 
Teachers’ Federation itself is contemplat- 
ing a similar action. The Association of 
Commerce his been interesting itself in the 
educational interests of the city, as well as 
in industrial and civic affairs. Since legi- 
timate industries seeking new locations fre- 
quently go quite fully into the efficiency of 
the school system, it is considered highly 
important that the school people should be 
in close touch with the work of the Associ- 
ation of Commerce.

Its affairs have been conducted in an intelli-

ness and courtesy have characterized every 
move of the Commission and the unanimity 
of its members is marked. There have been 
no quibblings, no jealousies, no differences and 
no personal axes to grind, and—no political 
debts to pay; therefore the Commission, in-

Smoke Banishment Activity 

Rocuester, N. Y.—A_ booklet entitled 
“The Smoke Shroud,” whose effective cover 
is here shown in reduced size, has been pub- 
lished by the Smoke Abatement Committee 
of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce. 
rhis should prove very valuable in the ef- 
fort to prevent the grievous havoc wrought 
by smoke. In addi- 
tion to a general 
survey of the 
smoke question, it 
gives practical ad- 
vice and informa- 
tion on the engi- 
neering phases of 





the problem, proper 
methods of hand 
firing, the opera- 
tion of mechanical 
Epes eseeeuev ren stokers and other 
data which, from 
an economic standpoint, are of great in- 
terest to business men. 

The Smoke Abatement Committee of the 
Rochester Chamber has collected a library 
of literature in pamphlet form treating in 
detail of practically all the devices and 














equipment designed to eliminate the smoke 
nuisance. There is also on file in the Cham- 
ber an exhaustive bibliography of smoke 
and smoke prevention.

Trading at Home 

Youncsrown, Ohio.—The Youngstown 
Chamber of Commerce has launched a 
“Trade in Youngstown” campaign which it 
is planned to have extend over several 
months. The campaign was opened by a 
contest in which prizes amounting to $100 
were offered for the six best reasons for 
trading in Youngstown. The six winning 
reasons are: 

Because: Unexcelled opportunities, splendid 
stores, fair prices, full assortments, honest 
dealings, make it to your advantage. 

Because: The prosperity of its citizens and 
neighbors depends upon its prosperity. In- 
creased trade means increased prosperity. 

Because: Quality, satisfaction and service 
are guaranteed by trading in Youngstown. 

Because: By trading in Youngstown, you 
provide more employment for people living in 
this trade territory. 

Because To see is to believe. Trade in 





Youngstown, where you can see what you 
buy. 

Because: Good roads enable farmers to send 
their products into Youngstown. They buy 
where they sell. 

These six good reasons for trading in 
Youngstown are shown on a large display 
card in the windows of all local merchants, 
and pasters reading “It Pays to Trade in 
Youngstown,” are used on all outgoing 
packages from the retail stores. 

Prizes amounting to $25 were also offered 
for the best two essays written by school 
children under 18 years upon the subject. 
One of the winning essays follows: 

“Money spent in Youngstown is circulated 
in our own markets or used in our own in- 
dustries for the upbuilding of our city and the 
welfare of our citizens. 

“In return for the advantages derived from 
living in a_ hustling, up-to-date city like 
Youngstown, its citizens should show their 
loyalty to home enterprises by assisting its 
merchants in establishing a trade center for 
the rich region of which this city is the me- 
tropolis. 

“Residents of Youngstown who so far forget 
their loyalty to the city whose advantages they 
enjoy as to transfer their trade to other cities, 
show a lack of appreciation of the splendid 
array of luxuries and necessities displayed in 
their home town, and practically suggest to 
outsiders an inferiority in the ‘Biggest little 
city on earth.’”

THE 


Clear Schedule of Work and 
Workers 

Sr. Louis, Mo.—The year book recently 
issued by the St. Louis Civic League, be- 
sides containing the reports upon the va- 
rious activities which have been undertaken 
by the League during the past year, gives a 
list of the committees and the program of 
work laid out for them for the year 1915 
arranged in a comprehensive manner. 
There is a list of the committees, with the 
names of persons serving on each, in one 
column; in a second column and opposite 
the respective committees are the names of 
the municipal departments in whose work 
the committee is naturally concerned and in 
which it plans to bring about improvements 
or reforms; and in the third column is a 
statement of the work which the committee 
is endeavoring to accomplish in such de- 
partment.

A Board of Trade Forum 


EvizApetu, N. J.—The broadening acti- 
vities of commercial organizations embrace 
not only problems of local interest, but also 
questions of state-wide or national impor- 
tance. In New Jersey at the present time 
two subjects of special interest throughout 
the state are the problem of taxation re- 
form and the election which is to be held 
in October on the proposed constitutional 
amendment for woman's suffrage. The

of such questions by devoting its regular

Improved Municipal Accounting 

ReapinG, Pa.—That the reorganization of

financial statistics in Reading by the New 
York Bureau of Municipal Research has re- 
sulted beneficially in the year since its in- 
stallation is attested in a pamphlet issued 
by the Committee on Municipal Affairs of 
the Reading Chamber of Commerce. The 
pamphlet is entitled “Why Money Was 
Spent,” and cites in parallel columns the 


conditions at the time of the survey in 
January, 1914, regarding which changes 


were suggested, and the changes effected as 
a result of the survey and acounting in-

Curbing the Impostor 


HARRISBURG, Pa.—Codperating with the 
Pennsylvania Commercial Secretaries’ As 
sociation, the Harrisburg Chamber of Com- 
merce is bending every effort to make as 
unprofitable as possible the business of im- 
proper vending, out-of-town charity solicit 
ing, advertisng and promotion 
schemes, that are taking too much money 
out of our cities. The Harrisburg Cham 
ber has placed before the principal com- 
mercial organizations in Pennsylvania and 
the press of the state generally a plan cal 
culated to be effective in intercepting the

The plan proposed is for every organiza- 
tion that is a member of the Pennsylvania 
Commercial Secretaries’ Association to en 
ter into an agreement that just as soon as 
they learn of any of the above schemes 
being operated in their respective cities, 
they will promptly advise every other mem 
ber by letter or bulletin, on the same day, 
if possible, the nature of the scheme, names 
of the parties working it, and kindred in- 
formation; if it is possible to ascertain the 
next city to be worked, to advise the sec- 
retary of the commercial organization in 
that city first of all, and the others later. 

The secretary receiving the information 
could fortify his city against the schemes,

either by special bulletin to all members, an 
announcement through the newspapers, by 
telephone, or in person, as the case could 
best be handled. While the plan outlined 
contemplates some work and expense, it is 
believed that they would be more than jus 


tified by every secretary codperating, and 
that it would be a useful social and business 
service to the state. ‘ 

Fifteen Pennsylvania commercial organ-

A Chamber of Commerce Campaign for 
Good Roads 


By Marx Woodruff 


Manager of Publicity, Portland Chamber of Commerce, Portland, Oregon 


bond issue for Multnomah County, 
Oregon, and creating a sentiment in 
favor of the proposition, the Portland 
Chamber of Commerce last month shat- 
tered a few traditions which have heretofore 


| taking hold of a proposed good roads 


caused such bodies in the principal cities of 
Oregon to refrain from taking a hand in 
matters of that kind. 

Multnomah County proposed a bond issue 
of $1,250,000. The money was to be used 
in building 70 miles of hard surface county 
roads in a district where only 3% miles had 
theretofore existed, and which would not 
only open a large amount of land for agri- 
cultural usefulness, but would complete the 
far-famed Columbia Highway, a 4o-mile 
drive along the Columbia River amidst some 
of the finest scenery of America. 

Knowing the value of these improve- 
ments, John B. Yeon, a millionaire lumber 
man, had been appointed county road mas- 
ter, without pay, for the purpose of giving 
his personal supervision to the road con- 
struction and as a guarantee that every 
dollar expended would get a dollar's worth 
of road. Simon Benson, another million- 
aire, expended large sums of his own money 
in investigating different types of road con- 
struction in the United States 

The bonding proposition having been 
framed and a special election having been 
called by the county officials, a new element 
entered into the situation. 

The politicians of the Portland Labor 
Council demanded a guarantee that all roads 
would be built by labor at $3.00 per day of 
eight hours. These demands being refused, 
the labor leaders announced their opposi- 


tion to the measure at the election. Other 
opposition developed from the small prop- 
erty owners. The bond issue appeared to 
be beaten. 

The election was set for April 12. 

This being the situation, President C. C. 
Colt, of the new Chamber of Commerce- 
an organization just completed, with over 
4,000 members—called a meeting just one 
week before election day. The situation 
was canvassed and it was found that there 
were approximately 8,000 idle men in Mult- 
nomah County and that about 3,000 of these 
could be given work for the summer if the 
bonds should be carried. It was discovered 
that the payment of the bonds in 15 years 
would mean an additional cost of 56 cents 
per annum for each $1,000 of valuation, 
and the big organization thoroughly under- 
stood the necessity of giving a growing 
farming population better marketing facili- 
ties, as well as of opening up scenic attrac- 
tions whose wonders are unknown to tourist 
traffic. 

The defeat of the bonds would have been 
a public calamity. 

President Colt organized a committee of 
800. The city and county were subdivided 
into small districts and a suitable district 
committee appointed for each. On April 
10 these committees began a systematic can- 
vass. Every voter was seen. Numbers of 
union labor organizations fell away from 
their leaders, and=the small property own- 
ers became convinced that the general re- 
sult of the bond issue would be of benefit to 
them. 

Tuesday night, April 12, election returns 
were received in the assembly room of the

mission was certain of its powers or consti- 
tutional status. The act provides for the 
appointment of shade tree commissions con- 
sisting of three residents of the municipal- 
ity, who serve without compensation. The 
commissioners elect one of their members 
as president and appoint a secretary and 
other employes, whose compensation they 
determine. 

No existing shade tree commission is 
abolished by the new law, but is deemed to 
exist by virtue of the law, provided that 
upon the expiration of the terms of such 
commissioners, their successors shall be ap 
pointed so as to constitute a commission of 
three members. The initial cost of all trees 
planted by the shade tree commission, in- 
cluding the cost of the posts and boxes or 
guards used for their protection, and the 
cost of removing any tree dangerous to pub 
lic safety, is made a lien upon the real 
property so improved, and unless paid di- 
rectly to the shade tree commission, is col- 
lected in the same manner as other taxes 
against the property. 

The act confers broad powers upon the 
commission in the complete control of the 
planting and care of shade and ornamental 
trees and shrubbery planted in any public 
highway, park or parkway of the municipal 
ity, including the right to regulate and con- 
trol the use of the ground surrounding such 
trees and shrubbery, so far as may be neces- 
sary for their proper growth, care and pro- 
tection.

The Chicago Billboard Case 


The Illinois Supreme Court has denied 
the petition of the Cusack Company for a 
rehearing, in its case against the city of 
Chicago, so that the decision now becomes 
final except as it may be appealed to the 
United States Supreme Court on constitu- 
tional grounds. This case was discussed at 
some length in the March number of Tur 
AMERICAN Cry, in an article entitled “Le- 
gal Handicaps in the Billboard Problem.” 
It involved a violation of the ordinance 
passed in 1911 requiring that frontage con- 
sents be obtained from the owners of a ma- 
jority of the property on both sides of a 
street in a block in which a billboard was to 
he erected if such block were one in which 
one-half the buildings on both sides of the 
street were used exclusively for residence 
purposes. In the particular case in which 





wm 
ty 
uw 


action was taken, a billboard was erected 
in a residence district in such a way as to 
block the view of several miles of lake 
frontage. When through the efforts of the 
Municipal Art Committee of the Chicago 
City Club the board was ordered torn down, 
the Cusack Company obtained an injunc- 
tion from the Superior Court of Cook 
County, prohibiting the city from enforcing 
this section of the ordinance. The Supreme 
Court of Illinois reversed the decision and 
dismissed the injunction. A rehearing was 
asked for, and it is this rehearing which 
has been denied.

Caring for Immigrants Upon Arrival 

Social workers are learning that one of 
the causes of the so-called immigrant prob- 
lem is the past neglect which has permitted 
incoming thousands to settle—rather, to 
drift—into the nearest community that pre 
sented itself, and thus add their multitudes 
to the population of the already congested 
eastern states. Several movements have 
recently been set going by which foreigners 
may receive the instruction needed to en 
able them to make intelligent choice of the 
portion of the United States in which they 
prefer to live. 

One of the latest of these movements is 
the one carried out by the city of Cleve 
land, Ohio. Fach immigrant who. upon ar 
riving at Ellis Island announces his destina 
tion as Cleveland, is given a neat booklet 
bearing the title, “The Immigrant’s Guid 
to the City of Cleveland, Ohio.” This book 
is the work of the city immigration officer, 
R. EF. Cole, and is issued in nine languages 
English, Italian, German, Hungarian, Pol 
ish, Bohemian, Slovak, Croatian and Yid 
dish. About 35,000 will be given out at 
railroad stations, evening schools for immi- 
grants, settlement houses, foreign societies 
and factories. 

The pamphlet contains advice to immi 
grants about discretion in making new ac- 
quaintances and about using wisely the op 
portunities and advantages of the new life: 
states the location of the most important 
points in the city: gives information about 
naturalization, extracts of important civil 
and criminal laws, rules for keeping in good 
health, an explanation of United States 
money, the rules governing the hospitals, a

The hill-like lumps are dirt—just plain 
dirt deposited there by the water. 






What’s in this filth, no one knows. 
Germs, perhaps—which will soon be 
carried by the water into your homes. 

When you are drinking water purified 
by a filtration plant, you are possibly 
' drinking water poisoned by the dirt 
inside your city water mains. 

Who knows? ‘The answer is below. 









The National Method 


is the most practical and best means of getting rid of all the dirt and 
disease in your city’s water mains. 

This method is very simple. It does not mean that your streets 
must be torn up, traffic blocked or new pipe laid. 

The National Method takes out all the dirt and obstructions 
in the water mains and leaves them as clean as new. And all this 
completed in the quickest possible time at the least possible expense.

Following Up the Clean-up 
Keeping the city in order from day to 
day, after the annual clean-up, is a problem 
which requires some ingenuity. To ward 
off a relapse into carelessness on the part of 
its spring-cleaned citizens, the Department 
of Public Property of New Orleans has re- 
cently issued a set of small folders called 
the “City Beautiful Series,” which it is ex 
pected will be effective in producing results. 
These are printed in a style to make them 
attractive and interesting, and are unique 
as to contents. In each case, as a practical 
part of the argument, it is stated that the 
Department is determined to put an end to 
the throwing of papers and rubbish upon 
the streets, and that stringent measures 
will be adopted to punish all violators of 
the city ordinances upon this subject. One 
of the folders, written in metrical form, is 
quoted in full:

trash upon the street, 
Just call up Mr. Policeman as he’s rounding

Orleans Association of Commerce, and 
other commercial organizations. Each ward 
in the city also has a representative on the 
Committee, and the Women’s Club has ren- 
dered valuable assistance in circulating the 
folders. It is interesting to note that each 
of the seventeen wards of New Orleans has

We show illustrations of our Canco Trash Burner and Canco Fly 
Trap, two articles to help in the “clean up” campaigns which are 
spreading over the country. 


“CANCO” RUBBISH AND 
TRASH BURNER 


This is practically the only burner on the market that will withstand 
heat without warping, the body being made 


from ONE PIECE OPEN HEARTH SHEET STEEL. 

Owing to its peculiar construction it is 
practically indestructible. All joints of the 
burner are welded; no rivets to become loose. 





Canco Burner is the only burner which has 
a solid bottom, detachable base or pan. With 
ordinary burners the ashes are generally scat- 
tered around 
wherever the 
rubbish is burnt, 
making an un- 
sightly appear- 
ance. 


“CANCO” FLY TRAPS 


There are some that look like Canco 
but they are about as similar as a 
“flivver’’ car is to a high speed racing 
car. First of all, the Canco is an all 
metal trap. No wood pieces to warp 
or rip off. It must wear and it'll catch 
more flies than Mr. Carter has pills. 
Joints are all electrically welded. It is 
made on strictly mechanical lines and 
after a careful study of other makes and 
their operation.

THE AMERICAN CITY 820 


One of the results of the New England 
town meeting plan in large towns has been 
the “packing” of the meetings in favor of 
certain candidates or projects. From this 
condition much undesirable politics has re- 
sulted. The new act provides for not less 
than 8 nor more than 12 districts, each of 
which shall elect 27 voters as its delegates 
to the town meeting. Of these 9 are chosen 
for three years, 9 for two and 9g for one. 
With these delegates the following officials 
will also serve: Brookline legislators, town 
moderator, clerk, treasurer, selectmen and 
chairmen of the boards of assessors, school 
committee, public library trustees, cemetery 
trustees, water, park, planning and tree 


boards, gymnasium and bath trustees and 


registered voters will be reserved 
ight to ballot for moderator, town 
ficers, town meeting members, and on the 
granting of liquor licenses, referenda and 
uestions to be settled in particular pre 
cincts, | ach candidate tor town meetit

signatures within his precinct, and the can

Wide Open or Alternate Specifications 


To the Editor of THe American City: 

The writer read with interest your edi 
torial in the March number on “Wide Open 
or Alternate Specifications?” and voices 
your desire for a wide discussion on this 
important subject 

lhe basis of laws governing contract let 
tings is ostensibly to prevent graft. Such 
laws are not drafted primarily for the 
moral uplift of the people, but to attempt 
to insure to the people value received for 
money expended in public works. <A thou- 
sand cases could be cited to prove that even 
the successful prev ention of graft does not 
mean that the taxpayers’ interests have been 
conserved. 

Contracts and specifications are too often 
drawn upon the sad assumption that officials 
responsible for the execution of the work 
under them are either dishonest or can read 
ily yield to dishonest influences. 

lhe general acceptance of the commis 
sion form of government, the city man 
ager plan, and all other such schemes for 
the concentration of power into the hands 
of the few, gives far wider latitude for 
graft and dishonesty than was possible un- 
der the old forms of government. But 
these forms of government on the whole 
have made good and are with us to stay. 
We must, therefore, take it for granted that 
persons elevated to such offices of public 
trust are imbued only with high and sincere 
motives of public welfare. It is, alas! too 
true that there have been, and perhaps al- 


ways will be, exceptions to the rule; but 
why adopt laws that hamper the best ef 
forts of the ninety-nine in a futile effort 
to prevent by law dishonesty in thi 


dredth man? Why restrict the actio 


men sworn to render, and in the vast 
jority of cases solemnly intent! n rendering 
the most efficient service to their cot 
uents ? Why, 11 i patented irticl 
patented process will best serve the 
interests, should they be hindered trom 

ing to the city that which thev conceive t 


be hest ? 

How often have we seen officials balk 
accepting material becaus« the price 
cluded a small percentage for royal 
for special or extraordinary qualification 
the bidder, simply to avoid criticis1 
to find in the end that their timidity 1 


made them parties to the delivery t 
city of something that was worth perl 
fifty per cent less than it cost! 

The frank recognition of patented article 
might be in the end the surest and satest 
road to legitimate competition, for it offer 


an incentive to men of an inventive 


to produce something that will be more et 
fective or can sell for less money than that 
now in the market. To-day, in public work 
the man with a patent is truly a suspicious 
character, having about his person a subtl 
something with which to corrupt public o1 
ficials, ALEXANDER POTTER,

cement in the joints may serve to protect the

bricks are laid properly, close 


other hand expansion joints, coming at a distance 
of 8 or 10 feet apart, must necessarily be so 
wide, in order to take up the great expansion, 
that protection of the edges is impossible and so 
in old cement-filled pavements you will find wide 
grooves running across the pavement at the ex- 
pansion joint where the exposed edges of the 
last line of bricks have been hammered into

dust. 


The use of Pitch Filler instead of cement obviates 
all these difficulties. Every joint is an expansion 
joint. In cold weather the pitch sinks in the 
joint as the block contracts, but as every joint is 
an expansion joint the amount is infinitesimal. 
In warm weather the pitch merely rises a little in 
the joint. In either case the pitch adheres firmly 
to the block, preserving an absolutely waterproof 
perfect seal. 

The best pitch for the purpose is Barrett’s 
Paving Pitch.

Fuller Park, Chicago 
Equipped with ingham 








Holstein Park, Chicago 
Equipped with Ingham Shower Mizers 


Safety for Bathers and Increased 
Capacity for Playground Showers 





Operating separate valves to regulate the hot and cold 
water on showers takes time, wastes steam and water 
and exposes the bather to danger of being scalded. 

Operating the Ingham Shower Mixer is condensed 
into one movement—the mere turning of the indicator 
handle 

The mixing of the steam, or hot water, with the cold 
water takes place automatically in the mixing chamber 
of the 


Ingham 
Shower Mixer 


and the bather has instant control of the desired tem- 
perature of the water. This prevents delay. The 
bather takes the minimum time and soon makes way for 
another. Thus the capacity of showers is largely 
increased. 

The mixer is ‘‘Fool-proof.”’ It is impossible for 
bathers to scald themselves. When installed, the 
mixer is permanently adjusted to give a pre-determined 
maximum temperature to the water. No movement of 
the handle by the bather can increase the temperature of 
water beyond this safety point. 

The Ingham Shower Mixer is noiseless, self-cleaning, 
and needs no adjustment or repairs. 

Costs less to maintain and operate than any other 
mixer 

Styles for individual and multiple showers. 

The safety, efficiency and economy of the Ingham 
Shower Mixer has led to its installation by many 
municipalities, as well as prominent Clubs, Hotels, 
Universities, Industrial Plants, etc. Don’t fail to write 
for our FREE Booklet, ‘A Good Mixer,” if you have 
anything to do with public or private shower bath 
equipments.

Reaching the Fire without Delay 

In a recent statement, F. H. Sawyer, of the 
Fire Truck Department, the Goodyear lire & 
Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, is quoted as fol 


lows 

“A fire truck tire must necessarily be 
trouble-proof. When making a run firemen 
have no time to stop for tire repairs Phe 


cushion type of tire offers the necessary ad 
vantages of safety, economy, durability 
resiliency. While not as resilient as a pneu 
matic, the cushion type has the advantage of 
not being subject to puncture, which is an 
important factor. The tire equipment on fire 
chiefs’ cars is usually pneumatic, 
the quality most desired 

“The Goodyear Cushion Tire has a 
tread notched to give gripping power and 
increase its non-skid value. The notches are 
so arranged as to provide space for the dis- 
placed rubber to go, and render the tire 
almost as resilient and easy riding as a pneu- 
matic tire

Liquid Chlorine as a Sterilizer 

Under the title of “Perfect Sterilization,” 
the Electro Bleaching Gas Company, of New 
York, has published a booklet of 24 pages 
which deals with the use of liquid chlorine in 
the sterilization of water and the disinfection 
of sewage. This booklet presents the subject 
in an attractive and convincing manner. It 
features the use of liquid chlorine in steriliz- 
ing the water-supply at the Panama-Pacific 
Exposition, as well as the successful use of 
this method in a number of other places. 
The various kinds of meter type equipment 
are described and illustrated, including one 
specially designed to meet the requirements 
of small municipalities and private water 
companies and of public baths and swimming 
pools. Some of the advantages of liquid 
chlorine are stated to be as follows: it re- 
tains its full strength indefinitely; it does not 
produce any taste or odor in the treated 
water; it prevents the development of after- 
growths; it eliminates labor costs involved in 
the sterilizing process by the use of the simple 
apparatus for regulating and controlling the 
application of the disinfectant; and it does 
not require the erection of special buildings 
for the apparatus, which occupies very little 


space,

Two cities that have just developed strong 
commercial organizations through the 
services of the American City Bureau 


N Muskogee, Oklahoma, a few months since, plenty of men could be found who were 

sure Muskogee could not support the sort of Chamber of Commerce that was possible 
in an Eastern city. “The country is too new,” they said. ‘The people have not had 
time to make their money.” 

In Jamestown, New York, there were many men who felt that their city could never 
hope for the things that were possible in a Western city. They felt that their fellow 
citizens lacked the driving power of ‘“‘that Western spirit.”’ 

Nevertheless, each of these cities has developed a strong, efficient commercial 


organization. JAMESTOWN, NEW YORK

The attractive booklet with this title con- 
tains a story of the making of the brick pro 
duced by the Metropolitan Paving Brick Com 
pany, of Canton, Ohio, and illustrates it with 
a profusion of views. The reader is taken on 
an imaginary visit to one of the six plants of 
this company: first to the shale bank at Can- 
ton, where the steam shovel scoops up the de- 


posit of brick-making material and dumps it 
into the waiting cars: then to the shale room, 
where there is at all times enoug th shale to 
make more than 800,000 paving bricks. The 
visitor then follows the processes of crushing 


and screening the 
moulding it, cutting, measuring and shaping the 
brick. The drying tunnels and the kilns are 
the next places of interest, and finally the stor- 


shale, mixing it with water, 





THE AMERICAN 





























Speed Tires 
Best ate in Goodyears 
For Heavy Apparatus 


No need to cut down fire truck speed be- 
cause solid tires demand it. Speed is what 
you want the most 

Yet the destructive vibration of solid tires 
has forced the speed of many trucks down to 
10 or 15 miles per hour 

Goodyear Cushion Fire Truck Tires are 
built for speeds up to 35 miles per hour. 

And they won’t rack the truck to pieces. 
The patented undercut sides, slantwise 
bridges and resilient construction take the 
shock, strain and jar, without injury to the 
truck. 

The anti-skid feature insures safety at 
high speeds and on quick, sharp turns, 


For Lighter Apparatus 
The Goodyear Fortified Tire with the All- 
Weather Tread is the ideal extra-strength 


pneumatic tire for lighter equipment. Gives 
perfect protection against slippery pave 
ments and rough going. Contains all the 


Goodyear features that insure security and 
prevent rim-cutting, skidding, tread separa- 
tion, blowouts. 

Last year on 60 per cent of all new equip- 
ment Goodyear tires were used. 

On this record we base our claim for favor 
—our claim for the best in fire truck tires.

Union Metal Lamp Standards 
ARE AS STANDARD AS GOLD COINAGE 


THEY ARE THE MOST FLEXIBLE, 
SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED, 
HIGH QUALITY LAMP STAND- 
ARDS AVAILABLE. 


THEY ARE THE ‘*‘ SAFETY FIRST ”’ 
STANDARDS. 


THEY ARE UP-TO-DATE IN EVERY 
RESPECT—THE MODERN STAND- 
ARDS THAT LEAD THE FIELD. 


Some Things You Should 


Know about 


UNION METAL LAMP STANDARDS 





1) Patented steel construction reduces 
weight to a minimum, thereby cut 
ting freight bills in two 


’) Erecting cost 1s greatly reduced owing to 


the scientific sectional construction 
and reduced weights 
The pressed steel shaft increases the 
strength at the point where cast iron 
standards are weak, and overcomes 
the serious danger of standards 
breaking off in case of sudden shock, 
permitting the standard to fall to the 
sidewalk, thereby endangering the 
lives of people nearby 
1) Union Metal Lamp Standards combining 
‘built up”’ fluted,pressed steel shafts, 
steel anchor and tie rods, and scientific 
sectional construction, are shock and 
vibration absorbers thus insuring 
safety and long life to both lamps and

PERFECT WOOD-BLOCK PAVING 
Long wear and satisfactory service are only possible with wood-block paving when it has been 
creosoted with the right oil. The service record of Reilly Improved Creosote Oil as a paving 
block preservative has established its reputation with municipal engineers throughout the 
country. This known service efficiency has led conservative engineers to specify Reilly Improved 
Creosote Oil for this work. Write for the FREE handbook.

Wherever real trailers of the bottom dump type are wanted, there 
you will find Watsons. The tractor shown is a Saurer. 


First, the city officials bought two Watson trailers for handling asphalt. They tested 
them thoroughly in actual service. Then they bought eleven more. 

The special chutes or pockets underneath the bottom doors are for asphalt patching pur- 
poses only. By this means any required quantity, however small, may be taken out with 
shovels—just as needed. The chutes for patching do not interfere in any way with the com- 
plete bottom dumping feature. The whole load or whatever is left of it, may be dumped 
instantly at any time. 

Watson trailers are REAL trailers. You are not asked to experiment. Remember that 
we furnish these trailers with four wheels for use behind any motor truck. Also as two-wheel 
or semi-trailers similar to the one shown here for use with tractors such as the Saurer, Garford, 
Knox, Peerless, etc 

Better get posted on the Watson trailers. Let us give you a list of users. The printed 
matter is interesting. Shall we send it?

Keep your city clean 


The first important step in a ‘“‘Civic Clean Up”’ is to keep 
paper and refuse off the street and out of the gutters. Provide 
a handy Majestic Refuse Receiver at various corners of your 
city and each citizen will use it for papers and refuse instead o 
littering up the sidewalk and streets. 


MAJESTIC 


Refuse Receiver | 
For City Streets and Park Boulevards | 


The Majestic is strong, durable and ornamental. The 
can sets into an ingot iron receptacle and the contents are pro 
tected from winds by iron top and lid. No papers or litter can 
be blown away and scattered. It is water-proof and with 
stands the severest elements. When can is filled it is easily 
lifted out for emptying. The Majestic Refuse Receiver 
should be included in every Civic Improvement.

TIRINUDAD xspaatr 


Getting Your Money’s | 
Worth in Pavements 














is not determined by first cost, but by 
performance. 


Suppose a lrinidad Lake Asphalt pavement does 
cost 15 cents a yard more than an oil asphalt pavement. 


What of it? If one Trinidad pavement lasts as long 
as two or three oil asphalt pavements, isn’t Trinidad 
worth the difference in first cost? . | 


The grading, foundation, stone, sand, and labor and 
other costs are the same whether you use Trinidad 
asphalt or a ‘‘cheap’’ substitute. The asphalt only 
forms 10 per cent. of the surface mixture. 


Why jeopardize the whole investment by trying to 
‘““save’’ a few cents on the asphalt? 


The best in the long run is never the cheapest in | 
the first instance. But, considering the service obtained 
per dollar expended, Trinidad pavements are the cheap- 
est as well as the best. Their record proves it. Ask 
or *‘Evidence.”’

is produced under the supervision of men who have had a 
lifetime experience in the refining of asphalts. The pro 
duction of asphalt is our chief business—not a side issue. 
Our product is not a residue of oil refining. Aztec is 
produced by careful distillation and under scientific and 
experienced supervision from straight Mexican maltha. 
It is a real natural asphalt. It combines those prime 
requisites necessary to the success of a high grade paving 
asphalt, viz.: high ductility, low susceptibility to ex- 
tremes of temperature, low volatilization loss. Remember 
that Aztec is not produced by the admixture of various 
and inferior grades of asphaltic oils and residues, still 
butts, ete., with just a blend of Mexican oil in order to 
impart certain qualities which barely enable other asphalts 
to pass wide open specifications, yet lacking the requisi_c 
merits of a high grade paving asphalt 


stands for high quality and uniformity. It is excelled 
by none and equalled by few. Don’t confuse Aztec 
asphalt with the heterogeneous mass of asphalt now on 
the market, and which certain oil refiners are vainly 
endeavoring to unload at any old price.
