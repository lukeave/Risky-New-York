IN RESERVOIR CLEANING 


At the filtration plant o1 the Cincinnati water-works, the settling basins were formerly cleaned 
as shown in the upper picture—three men dragging the heavy 2\-inch hose, with the water at fron J 
100 to 115 pounds pressure. A strong wooden frame on rollers, provided with a swivel joint and 4 
movable nozzle, now reduces to one the number of men required to handle the hose«

CASTIRON PIPE ~ 


ROOT, ie 








From New York Harbor 
to the Golden Gate 


The verdict of the country is practically unanimous on the question of 
Using cast iron pipe for water works distribution systems. Cast Iron Pipe 
possesses sterling advantages which time has never shaken; and, in fact, 
each passing year strengthens the standing of cast iron pipe by adding toa 
record for permanence already 250 years old. 


Bell and Spigot Cast Iron Pipe 


is the acknowledged standard as to weight, length, and type of joint. 
There's economy in using it. It is the only logical answer when comparing 
Cast lron Pipe with The Substituted Products. It is the pipe which stands 
for the greatest degree of service and economy; the pipe which will last the 
longest and give the best service at the lowest cost.

A Fire Hose 


of unusually careful manufacture 


Wax and Para Gum Treated 


The lining is of fine Para Gum, hand made, 
four calendered, smooth bore or lap-jointed. 


Circular balance woven, 
each strand of cotton is 
treated to a bath of melted 
Wax and Para Gum, then 
cabled and woven into the 
jackets. 


Absolutely waterproof, 
making the ideal hose for 
fire departments. 


Treatment lubricates and 
solidifies the strands of cot- 
tony assuring long wear.

1 to 6 inches inside diameter

Bi-Lateral 
Fire Hose 





End View of Bt-Lateral Hose Flatiened 


Will not crack 


There is nearly two and a half times the 
usual amount of service in Bi-Lateral Fire 
Hose. Judge for yourself: 

The rubber lining is left free from its jacket 
in Bi-Lateral Hose where congestion takes 
place in hose of old construction. By allow- 
ing the rubber lining here its freedom, when 
the hose is flattened, the Bi-Lateral tube 
takes two curves at the points of fold, which 
relieves the compression (see illustration) 
whether the hose is flat or under pressure. 

It is the most pliable hose made and can 
be flattened without injury.

Sous works

Do you need a meter capable of measur- 
ing large flows correctly and which, at the 
same time, will be accurate on small flows? 


The Nilo Compound meter is a combination of the Nilo meter, 
a high-duty meter of acknowledged accuracy, durability and capacity 
and the King Disk meter, claimed to be unexcelled in accuracy in all 
flows within its capacity, together with an automatic double differ- 
ential vertical valve, guided and united by a central system. 

When the flow is such that the high-duty meter cannot correctly 
record the amount, the automatic differential valve closes, and the 
water passes through and is registered by the low-duty meter only. 
The combined reading of the two meters is the amount of water 
drawn. In no case is the water registered twice. 


If interested in water meters of any sort let us send you our printed 
matter.

If water meters were used only as sinkers for deep sea

for meters when you could get others just as heavy for $5.00 


and $6.00? 


But rules that apply to,the purchase of sinkers do not apply 
with equal force in buying products for other purposes. And 
it is generally admitted that the purpose of a water meter is 
to measure water and to measure it accurately and at all

High Pressure Spraying 


High pressure spraying is plus spraying 
—it 1s 100% efficient. 

300 lbs. pressure completely atomizes 
the solution into a penetrating fog-like 
mist that seeks out and adheres to every 
particle of foliage. The atomization is so 
perfect that drops 
will not form on 
the leaf and fall off, 
wasting the solu- 
tion, and so little 
solution is required 
as to prevent any 
possibility of in-

Neighborizing the Farmer 


One of the most significant facts 
of our telephone progress is that one- 
fourth of the 9,000,000 telephones in 
the Bell System are rural. 

In the days when the telepnone was 
merely a “‘city convenience, the farms of 
the country were so many separated 
units, far removed from the centers of 
population, and isolated by distance 
and lack of facilities for communication. 

But, as the telephone reached out 
beyond cities and towns, it completely 
transformed farm life. It created new 
rural neighborhoods here, there and 
everywhere. 

Stretching to the farthest corners of 
the states, it brought the remotest vil- 
lages and isolated places into direct 
contact with the larger communities. 

Today, the American farmer enjoys 
the same facilities for instant, direct

communication as the city dweller. 
Though distances between farms are 
reckoned in miles as the crow flies, the 
telephone brings every one as close as 
next door. Though it be half a day’s 
journey to the village, the farmer is but 
a telephone call away. 


Aside from its neighborhood value, 


the telephone keeps the farmer in touch 
with the city and abreast of the times. 


The Bell System has always recog- 
nized rural telephone development as 
an essential factor of Universal Service. 
It has co-operated with the farmer to 
achieve this aim. 

The result is that the Bell System 
reaches more places than there are post 
offices and includes as many rural 
telephones as there are telephones of 
all kinds in Great Britain, France and 
Germany combined.

Scope for Municipal Activity Pending Town 
Planning Legislation 


By Thomas Adams 


Town Planning Adviser, Commission of Conservation, Ottawa, Canada 


N an article in the March number of 
THe AMERICAN City I stated that the 
preparation of town planning schemes 

should be preceded by legislation. I do not 
mean by this that there is no preparatory 
work that can profitably be done by muni- 
cipalities or bodies of citizens interested in 
the planning of their cities prior to the 
passing of legislation. But I think that it 
is limited to a comparatively small, although 
very important, field. 

It is not desirable that municipalities or 
commissions representing groups of muni- 
cipalities should prepare comprehensive 
plans without first obtaining authority to 
control, during the time the scheme is being 
prepared, the area proposed to be planned. 
Power for this purpose is necessary, 
whether it be obtained by a special act to 
meet the particular case or by a general act 
for a whole state or province. Many cities 
have had town planning reports and plans 
prepared at considerable cost and have been 
disappointed to find, after the work was 
done, that it was almost impossible to put 
the proposals into practice. This may have 
been due, not to any defect in the proposals 
themselves, but to the fact that the schemes 
were prepared without the municipality first 
having obtained power to carry them out 
and without regard having been paid to the 
cost and how it could be met. When the 
right steps are taken and the right order 
of procedure is followed, it is quite prac- 
ticable to settle the financial details of the 
scheme during its preparation, and it has 
to be borne in mind that every scheme must 
be capable of being tested from the point 
of view of its economic soundness. It is 
not a question of sacrificing ideals or prin- 


ciples; that result need not follow, and, be- 
sides, it is a separate matter. It is a ques- 
tion of the simple necessity in a democratic 
country of justifying whatever proposals 
are made on their feasibility from a finan 
cial standpoint. 

To accomplish the above end it is neces 
sary that all town planning schemes, when 
prepared, should be accompanied by esti 
mates of the cost of carrying them out 
his means that the process of preparing 
a scheme has to proceed along certain def 
inite lines in conformity with legal prac- 
tice, and that the codperation of owners of 
land has to be sought before and not after 
the scheme is made. Moreover, it requires 
that owners shall not have the power to 
defeat or contravene a scheme while it is 
in course of preparation. 


Four Stages of Procedure 

The preparation of a practical schem« 
along these lines involves four stages of 
procedure as follows: 

1. Preliminary survey to determine the 
area to be planned and to obtain a map of 
existing sociological and physical condi 
tions. 

2. Obtaining authority to control the area 
during preparation of the scheme, so as to 
prevent anything being done to contravene 
it, or any speculation in values likely to be 
created by it. 

3. Preparing the scheme and getting ap- 
proval by or on behalf of the Legislature. 

4. Operating the scheme after it has been 
approved. 

In democratic countries, such as the 
United States or Canada, it is necessary to 
proceed in the above order, and only the 


[379] 





REF OO Ry 








380 THE AMERICAN CITY 


first stage can be effectively carried out 
without legislation. The scope for munici- 
pal activity pending the passing of legisla- 
tion is therefore practically limited to pre- 
paring a preliminary survey and map of 
existing conditions. 


The Kind of Map Needed 


The preparation of such a survey and 
map is urgent and of great importance. 
he customary blue-print showing the 
streets and subdivisions, and not even dif- 
ferentiating between portions built upon 
and vacant land, is of little value for town 
planning purposes. The need is for a 
printed map showing accurately the follow- 
ing details: 

1. Existing and approved streets, foot- 
paths and fences; differentiating between 
those streets actually formed or made and 
those which have beén simply approved by 
the local authority. 

2. Buildings erected and in course of 
erection; distinguishing between public 
buildings, factories, residences, etc. 

3. Railways, canals and other artificial 
features. 

4. Lakes, streams, marshy land, groups 
of trees and other natural features. 


In short, what is required is a map show- 
ing the existing development and general 
physical character of the area, in the same 
way as this is shown on the ordnance sur- 
vey maps in Great Britain. The need for 
such maps for United States and Canadian 
cities and their environs is all the greater 
because of the extent to which land has 
heen subdivided beyond the limits of the 
built-upon areas of most cities. 

With regard to levels, all that is neces- 
sary on the preliminary survey map is to 
show spot levels at frequent intervals along 
the existing roads, or perhaps along streams 
and on high elevations. Contour maps 
showing precise intervals of level every 5, 
10, 25 or more feet are not necessary at this 
stage, although in undulating areas they 
will be required when the scheme comes to 
be prepared. On the whole, it will be more 
economical to prepare them in the first stage 
if sufficient funds are available for the pur- 
pose. This is a matter which will have to 
be decided according to local circumstances. 
When the preliminary survey is completed, 
copies of the map might usefully be em- 
ployed to show the distribution of popula- 
tion and of industries and the traffic condi- 


tions of the city. All that is work which 
can be profitably carried out without dan- 
ger, in advance of legislation, but to go 
further is to jeopardize any scheme which 
it is proposed to prepare. 

For town planning schemes and for gen- 
eral use, apart from precise engineering 
purposes, it would suffice if the maps were 
prepared on a scale of 200 feet to one inch, 
as in the case of the Cincinnati survey, so 
that a comparatively large town could be 
placed on a map of workable size; but for 
many purposes a scale of 400 feet to one 
inch, as has been followed in the case of 
the Baltimore survey, would be more useful. 
The small scale map of part of the suburbs 
of Edinburgh, Scotland—88o0 feet to one 
inch—is a useful map for many purposes, 
but is not large enough to enable precise 
areas to be fixed. But even on this small 
scale, the British maps give an almost accu- 
rate idea of the character of a district. One 
of the difficulties in connection with the 
preparation of such maps is that they re- 
quire the services of men of special engi- 
neering training and experience, and they 
can be prepared economically only if the 
work is supervised by someone who has 
done similar work before. For this reason 
it would be a great advantage if some prac- 
tical means were found to enable the de- 
partments of the Federal and Dominion 
governments which are engaged in pre- 
paring survey maps to give assistance to 
municipalities on terms to be mutually ar- 
ranged. The work could be made to a large 
extent revenue-producing, and would be a 
good investment. In the absence of such 
assistance, the expert help of landscape 
architects and engineers should be obtained. 


A Symposium Suggested 

As the points raised in this article cast 
some doubt on the practical utility of the 
methods pursued by numerous town plan- 
ning commissions which have gone to the 
expense of preparing elaborate town plan- 
ning schemes without first obtaining legisla- 
tion to carry them out, it might be inter- 
esting to secure a symposium of opinion on 
the subject. So many excellent reports and 
schemes have been prepared that the time 
appears to have arrived for obtaining a col- 
lection of views as to the extent to which 
such schemes have been carried into exe- 
cution, or the extent to which there has 
been failure to make them operative, either 
for the reasons I have indicated or others. 
































A Few Interesting Things About the Cin- 
cinnati Water-Works 


Common Sense ‘‘Kinks’’ and Economies Based on Practical Experience in the 


Operation of a Modern Water-Works System 


By C. R. Hebble 


INCINNATIANS have good cause to 

be proud of their water-works—muni- 

cipally owned, modern in equipment, 
and managed with a high f ef 
ficiency. 


degree ort et- 


In 1907 the city had on its hands a piant 
which was a genuine curiosity in its me- 
chanical equipment, supplying raw, unpal- 
atable river water which was responsible 
for hundreds of deaths from typhoid fever. 

The new $12,000,000 plant, placed in use 
that year, supplies clear, pure water; and 
the deaths from typhoid fever in 1914 were 
but 23 in number, one-fourth of these be- 
ing traced to probable contagion contracted 
while outside the city. This gives Cincin- 
nati what is believed to be the lowest death 
rate from typhoid fever of any city in the 
country. 


Economies in Filtration Plant 

rhe settling basins at the filtration plant 
were formerly cleaned by 2%-inch fire hose, 
with the water at 100 to 115 pounds pres- 
sure. It then took three men to do this 
work. A heavy wooden frame on rollers 
so that 
about, 


it can be moved 
reduces the 
number of men to one. 
This frame is provided 
with a swivel joint and 
movable nozzle, and is 
constructed heavy enough 
to make it easy to direct 
the stream of water. The 
two illustrations on the 
cover of this issue show 
the former and present 
methods. 

The filtration plant is 
493 by 131 feet in size. 
In it are 28 filtration beds, 
each 50 by 28 feet. In the 
bottom of each bed has 
been a_ specially con- 
structed wire screen (70 
per cent copper), upon 
which was laid 8 inches of

it was found that these screens had det 
riorated and would need renewal at a cost 
of perhaps $10,000 or $11,000. 

Before purchasing the new screens, how 
ever, an experimental filter was constructé 
with the hope that some plan might be ce 
vised by which the use of the screens could 
be eliminated, as they last only about eight 
years. It that 
factory results were obtained by iaying

Stores Control System 

loo few water-works have a proper ac- 
counting system for stores; stores’ ledgers 
may be kept after a fashion, but hardly any 
of them are under accounting control or 
really safeguard such property. In 1914 the 
Cincinnati department purchased supplies to 
the value of $187,579.17. The stores control 
system which has been in use for about two 
years keeps all supplies and material under 
strict control. 

One of the store rooms 
(that of the filtration : 
plant) is here illustrated. | 
Three years ago it was 
an unused basement room, 
wholly without ventilation 
or light and with but a 
single inside door. Now 
it is provided with an out- 
side entrance through 
which automobiles can be 
driven and which at night 
in summer is closed with 
a locked iron grating. The 
stores are kept behind 
locked partitions in clas- 
sification bins and acces- 
sible to only one person, 
the storekeeper, who is 
held strictly accountable 
for this property, usually 
about $12,000 in value. 


Phe pric of the Stor 
keeper in the conditior 
his departm« nt and il 
accuracy of his records is 
worthy of note. 


New Pumping Equipment 
The erowth of the cit 
which now covers an area 
of about 72 square miles 
has made new equipment 
necessary in the Wester 
Hills station. A new 7 
000,000-gallon, vertical 
triple expansion pumpil 
engine; two 220-H. P 
boilers, and a new brick 
chimney 5% x 150 feet, as 
well as additions to the 
building and a new stor 


7,000,000-GALLON room, make up this im 


provement which has just 

been completed 
Cincinnati not only enjoys the ownershi 
of this strictly modern plant, but takes prick 
also in the fact that it is entirely self-su 


taining. The revenue covers all expensé 
including the interest and sinking fund 
all bonded indebtedness. A large majority 


of the water connections are metered Phe 
meter rate is 8 cents per 100 cubic feet, with 
a minimum charge of 30 cents per month 
No charge is made for water furnished to 
the city for public purposes.

Stopping the Use of 
Water Funds for 
General City 
Expenses 


By Robert B. Blackmore 


Commissoner of Water-Works, Fargo, 
North Dakota 


HE city of Fargo 
held on April 6 the 
first referendum 

election under its commis 
sion government charter. 
The election was the re- 
sult of a difference of 
opinion among the city 
commissioners as to the 
proper method of paying 
for the water supplied by 
its new municipal water- 
works plant for fire pro- 
tection, street sprinkling, 
flushing sewers and other 
municipal uses. 

It was the contention of 
the writer of this arti- 
cle that water used for 
general city purposes 
should be paid for by gen- 
eral taxation and not by 
the water rents or rates 
collected from _ private 
consumers, Failing to 
bring the other commis- 
sioners to this way of 
thinking, the initiative 
was invoked for the pass- 
age of a new water-works 
ordinance. The campaign 
was a lively one, the two 
principal newspapers of 
the city taking opposite 
sides. A picturesque fea 
ture was a prominent ad- 
vertisement illustrated 
with two cartoons and 
here reproduced in con 
siderably reduced size, 

The new ordinance, 
which was adopted by a 
considerable majority and 
which is now in force, 
Stipulates that the muni 
cipality “shall provide by 
taxation for water used,

Public Health Improvements Following the 
Disinfection of Water Supplies 


N a recent paper before the New York 
Section of the American Water-Works 
Association, valuable data on the 

present status of the disinfection of water- 
supplies were presented by Francis F. Long 
ley, of the firm of Hazen, Whipple & Fuller 
The statistics given were based on more 
than 100 replies received from inquiries sent 
to water-works throughout the United 
States and Canada in which some method 
of disinfection is used. Of all the water 
works heard from, about 80 per cent are 
stated to use or to have used hypochlorite of 
lime and the rest liquid chlorine. Many 
other figures as to cost, equipment, etc., are 
given. 

The paper contains the following state 
ments of improvements which have resulted 
in a number of places: 

In Cleveland, Ohio, the chlorination of th 
water-supply started in September, tort. In 
the six calendar years prior to this the typhoid 
death rates had varied from 13.0 to 20.2, with 
an average of 16.5 per 100,000. In the three 
calendar years following, the typhoid death 
rates were from 6.2 to 13.5, with an average of 
9.2 per 100,000. 

In Yonkers, N. Y., the analyst in charge of 
the water-supply states that prior to the use of 
hypochlorite, but with the water filtered 
through sand filters, two epidemics of dysen- 
tery were recorded at times when the water 
was unusually high in bacteria. Disinfection 
by means of hypochlorite was put in use early 
in 1910. Since that time there have been no 
such excessive bacterial counts and no cor- 
responding epidemics of dysentery. 

In Evanston, Ill, there has been an actual 
reduction in intestinal diseases, indicated by 
the statistics of typhoid fever and gastro en- 


teritis, which appears to have resulted fron 
the application of disinfection. This was firs 
applied in December, 1911 The statistics at 


hand cover the period of four years prior to 
this, namely, 1908 to 1911, inclusive; and three 
years after, 1912, 1913 and 1914. The deatl 
rate from typhoid in the former period vari 
from 24 to 33, averaging 29 per 100,000. | 


the period since disinfection it has vari 
from 6 to 15, with an average of 12 Phe 
death rate from gastro enteritis during the 
former period varied from 25 to 73, with a1 
average of 49 per 100,000; and in the latter 
period with disinfection varied from 11 t 40 


with an average of 30 
In the city of Baltimore there has been a 


decided reduction in the typhoid mortality 
since the use of calci hypochlorite. It was 
first used in June, tort. In the five years 
prior to that the death rate from typhoid va 
ried from 33 to 42 per 100,000, with a1 


average of 35. In the three years since, it 
has varied from 22 to 24, with an average of 


- 3 

In Poughkeepsie the disinfection of the sup 
ply was first begun in 1908 in the form of 
hypochlorite applied to the water before sedi 
mentation and filtration. The death rate fro 


typhoid fever for eight years prior to 1908, as 
indicated by the U. S. Census reports, varied 
from 25 to It4, with an average of 54 per 
100,000. From 1908 to 1913, with treatment 
as stated above, the typhoid death rate varied 


from 10.3 to 33, with an average of 18.5 
Since early in the year 1914 the filter effluent 
has also been treated, first by means of hypo 
chlorite, and latterly by means of liquid 
chlorine, and the death rate from typhoid 
fever for that year was 3.4 per 100,000. 
Trenton, N. J., is one of the most striking 
cases of improvement due to disinfectior 
Prior to I9QI2 the city used the raw Delawar« 
River water. In December, 1911, the authori 
ties commenced to treat the water-supply with 
hypochlorite. During the five years ending with

anne

1911 the total annual number of typhoid cases 
varied from 208 to 343, with an average of 
207. During the three years since disinfection 
has been applied, the number of cases in the 
city has varied from 45 to 110, with an 
average of 74 

In Ottawa the water of the Ottawa River 
was used without treatment until about March, 
i912. Its polluted condition was evidenced by 
the several epidemics of water-borne typhoid 
that the city had been through just prior to 
that. Since the disinfection of the supply, 
Ottawa has had no further epidemics and only 
a moderate death rate from typhoid 

The city of Hull, with only about one- 
twentieth the population of Ottawa, lying on 
the opposite bank of the river, takes its water- 
supply, untreated, from the same channel as 
does Ottawa and within a few hundred yards 
of it. In two recent months Hull has had 
about 200 cases of typhoid fever, as against 28 
in Ottawa for the same period 

In Centralia, Wash., during the winter of 
1913 and 1914 there was a sharp epidemic of 
typhoid fever, due apparently to the pollution 
of a well-supply by overflow of a stream which 
is known to have carried pollution. A hypo- 
chlorite plant was hastily installed and put in 


operation, and this was followed by a quite 
definite and abrupt cessation of new cases of 
typhoid, since which time there have been no 
cases in Centralia, with the exception of cer- 
tain hospital cases brought in from outside 
the community. 


The results of hypochlorite treatment in 
Pittsburgh have indicated an improvement in 
typhoid conditions over and above that se- 
cured by filtration alone. Hypochlorite was 
first applied in November, to11. In_ that 
month there were 54 cases; in December, 42: 
in January, 1912, there were 20; and in Feb- 
ruary, 5. From that time forward the cases 
have remained for the most part less than 10 
per month, and have never again approached 
the high points of previous years. It is rare 
for the present high points to reach the for- 
mer low points of the curve. 


In Wilmington, Del., the excellent protec- 
tion which disinfection affords was shown 
at the time of an epidemic of typhoid fever 
of about 250 cases at Coatesville, Pa., some 27 
miles above Wilmington, upon the stream from 
which Wilmington draws its supply. The 
epidemic made its appearance in Wilmington, 
but was stopped short by the disinfection of 
the water-supply 





Legal Obligation to 


\ water company is under legal as well as 
moral obligations to supply its customers 
with pure, wholesome water, and is liable 
for damages if it fails to do so. This is the 
substance of a recent decision of the Su- 
preme Court of New Jersey in the case of 
B. H. Jones against the Mt. Holly Water 
Company, as reported in the Newark Even- 
ing News. An epidemic of typhoid broke 
out in Mt. Holly in 1912 and three of the 
plaintiff's children became ill. He sued to 
recover for medical aid and attendance, 
claiming that the sickness was due to pol- 
luted water supplied by the company. The 
jury awarded $750 damages, and the Su- 
preme Court, on appeal, has upheld the 
award. 


Furnish Pure Water 


It was not necessary, the court held, to 
prove with certainty, as a matter of law, 
that the water was the cause of the out- 
break, reasonable certainty being sufficient 
grounds for suit. The company had knowl- 
edge, it was shown, that the water-supply 
of Mt. Holly was polluted for more than 
three years before the epidemic broke out. 

The court laid much stress on the obliga- 
tion of the company to provide clean, whole- 
some water, and this ruling raises the ques- 
tion whether cities providing their own 
water-supplies are not subject to lawsuits 
and damages, as well as private corpora- 
tions, if they subject their citizens to sick- 
ness and epidemic through failure to supply 
good water.

Service Instruction for Police Officers 


By Leonhard Felix 


Fuld, LL. M., Ph. D. 


Assistant Chief Examiner, Municipal Civil Service Commission, New York 


CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION.—In most of 
the large American cities applicants for ap- 
pointment on the police force are required 
to pass an examination conducted by the 
civil service commission, which is an inde- 
pendent examining body. This civil ser- 
vice examination consists of a thorough 
physical and medical examination of the 
applicant and a written examination. The 
written examination usually tests the appli- 
cant’s knowledge of city government, of 
city localities, of the duties of the position, 
and of arithmetic, and frequently includes 
a memory test and questions on the rules 
and regulations of the police department. 
Only those candidates who pass the civil 
service examination may be appointed on 
the police force, and frequently they are 
obliged to undergo a second physical ex- 
amination by the police surgeon before they 
are appointed. 

INSTRUCTION IN PRECINCTS.—In most 
American cities recruits are assigned to 
precincts, and the captains of the precincts 
are required under the rules of the depart- 
ment to instruct them regarding the laws 
and ordinances, the rules and regulations 
of the department, the methods of perform- 
ing police duty, the powers of police officers 
and the like. The period of instruction is 
seldom prescribed by the rules, and the in- 
struction is only sometimes supplemented 
by a tour of duty on the street with an ex- 
perienced police officer. 

SCHOOL FOR RECRUITS.—In the largest 
American cities there is a police school of 
instruction to which recruits are sent for 
systematic instruction before they are as- 
signed to duty. The course of instruction 
usually covers thirty days, although in New 
York recruits are assigned to the school for 
a period of twelve weeks. In most cities 
the course of instruction in the school for 
recruits covers only the city ordinances, the 
state laws, the rules of the department and 
instruction in first aid to the injured. 

THE NEW YORK scnoo..—The New York 
School for Recruits has a comprehensive 
curriculum for the instruction of its stu- 
dents in mental subjects, in practical police 


[390] 


work, in physical training and in the use of 
firearms. Classroom instruction is given in 
twenty-two subjects. Reviews are held 
daily and examinations are given weekly, 
the papers being rated by the instructors 
and records of scholarship being kept. In 
addition, each recruit is assigned home 
work consisting of reports involving the 
interpretation and the application of rules 
and regulations, laws and ordinances, and 
usages and customs. 

MENTAL SUBJECTS.—The subjects taught 
in the New York School for Recruits, in the 
order of their importance and the amount 
of time devoted to each, are: (1) Report 
Making, (2) Traffic and Animals, (3) Ar- 
rests, (4) Sanitary Code, Public Nuisances 
and Cooperation with City Departments, 
(5) Burglary, (6) Crime Classification, (7) 
Robbery and Larceny, (8) Homicide, (9) 
Public Morals, (10) Observation, (11) 
Fires and Accidents, (12) Felonies and 
Misdemeanors, (13) Children, (14) Patrol, 
(15) Disorderly Conduct, (16) Assault and 
Weapons, (17) Court Procedure, (18) 
General Ordinances, (19) Malicious Mis- 
chief, (20) Election Law, (21) Deport- 
ment, (22) Sabbath Law. 

PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION.—Recruits while 
attending the school receive the following 
practical instruction in New York: 

1. At night they are assigned to a busy 
precinct, and are required to accompany the 
patrolman assigned to house duty on all 
cases requiring police attention. 

2. On each Saturday and Sunday night 
they are assigned to patrol duty with a supe- 
rior officer, who instructs them in the man- 
ner of performing patrol and the customs 
and usages of a patrolman. 

3. Several times during the course they 
are assigned in pairs on busy streets for the 
purpose of observation; they are visited by 
an instructor, to whom they report viola- 
tions of law observed by them, conditions 
requiring police attention and places to be 
investigated with reference to their licenses. 

4. Lectures on first aid to the injured are 
given by police surgeons, and lectures on 
the importance of preserving finger impres- 





oa ae 





ga eee omar 








THE AMERICAN CITY 


sions and on descriptive portrait identifica- 
tion are given by officers of the Detective 
Bureau. 

5. They are sent on the street to obtain 
cases for presentation at moot courts, and 
are also assigned several times during their 
course to visit the day and night courts to 
observe the manner of arraigning prisoners 
and presenting evidence. 

6. Each morning they attend the line-up 
of arrested criminals at headquarters and 
the lectures by detectives specializing in 
paricular crimes. 

PHYSICAL TRAINING.—In the New York 
school one and one-half hours are devoted 
daily to physical training. The instruction 
includes the following: 

1. “School of the Soldier” and “Setting- 
Up Exercises” of the United States Army. 

2. Methods of handling prisoners hu- 
manely and breaking holds of prisoners by 
means of the American and the Japanese 
methods of wrestling. 

3. Manner of scaling fire escape ladders 
from sidewalk and carrying unconscious or 
dead persons up and down ladders. 

4. Each recruit is given one hour of in- 
struction each week at a public bath and in 
rescuing drowning persons. 

5. Each recruit is instructed in the care 
and use of revolvers at a rifle range in 
Police Headquarters and is given during his 
course twenty rounds of five shots at a tar- 
get, fifteen yards distance, with four-inch 
bull’s eye. 

INSTRUCTION FOR PROMOTION.—Very few 
American cities give their police officers 
any instruction after their permanent ap- 
pointment with a view to increasing their 
efficiency or with a view to fitting them for 
promotion. Although a few of the largest 


39! 


cities, as New York, Philadelphia and St 
Louis, have efficient schools for the training 
of policemen during their probation period, 
other cities—as, for example, San Francisco 
—require applicants for appointment to 
study the rules and regulations of the de- 
partment, the manual of the police depart- 
ment and the principles of first aid to the 
injured before they are appointed. They 
furnish to all applicants text-books on these 
subjects, which the applicants must study 
carefully in order that they may be atle to 
pass the civil service examination for ap 
pointment. 

SERVICE PERIODICALS.—Although no Amer 
ican city gives its policemen any instruction 
tending to assist them in the performance 
of their duties from day to day, or to assist 
them in fitting themselves for promotion, 
two cities, St. Louis and Cleveland, have 
established service periodicals which are 
distributed to the members of the force at 
weekly or semi-monthly intervals. By their 
clear exposition of newly enacted laws and 
ordinances, by their publication of civil ser- 
vice promotion examination questions and 
answers, by their editorials on subjects of 
professional customs and ethics, by their 
mention of individual meritorious acts and 
by their answers to queries on police sub- 
jects, these periodicals exert a powerful 
influence. They aid in raising the efficiency 
of the department, in educating the ambi- 
tious members of the force and in filling 
temporarily the want which conscientious 
police officers so frequently feel when they 
seek instruction and direction which their 
commanding officers are unable to supply 
and which a service school ought to supply 
to enable them to perform their duties ef- 
ficiently and to prepare for promotion. 





Restricting Garage Locations 


A section of an ordinance in force in 
a suburb of Chicago reads: “It shall not 
be lawful for any person or corporation to 
locate, build, construct or maintain in the 
village of Oak Park, on any site where 
two-thirds of the buildings within a radius 
of 500 feet of the proposed site are used 
exclusively for residence purposes, a build- 
ing for a public garage * * * without writ- 
ten consent of a majority of the property 
owners, according to frontage, within a 
radius of 500 feet of the proposed site of 


the building.” 

In a decision lately handed down by the 
Supreme Court of Illinois, in the case of 
People vs. Village of Oak Park, 107 North- 
eastern Reporter 636, the validity of this 
regulation was sustained as constituting a 
valid exercise of the police power of a 
municipality. It was further held that the 
ordinance applies to garages which were in 
existence when the ordinance was passed, 
and hence does not discriminate against 
those sought to be established afterwards.

CARRYING OUT THE CITY PLAN 


The Widening of Robert Street, St. Paul 


By J. Clair Stone 


Secretary, City Planning Commission, St. Paul, Minn. 


HE year 1914 was the busiest building 
T year in the history of St. Paul, Minn. 
Many important projects contributed 
to establish this record, and one of special 
interest to American cities was the widen- 
ing of Robert Street, an important down- 
town shopping street and thoroughfare. 
This was not only a big improvement in 
itself, but it furnished a strong impetus to 
the general building activities of the city. 

The improvement of Robert Street is a 
direct result of the city planning study made 
for St. Paul by John Nolen in 1911, in 
which he recommended and_ suggested 
methods of widening not only Robert 
Street, but also Wabasha and Seventh 
Streets. In his report he said: 

“The method adopted by St. Paul for city 
planning is in two respects somewhat novel 
among American cities. First, in beginning 
with the built-up business district; and sec- 
ond, in attempting to execute as promptly as 
practicable any plans that are approved. This 
shows that the true pioneer spirit which has 
already accomplished so much in and for St. 
Paul is ready to undertake even larger tasks. 
It is the intention of St. Paul to head off the 
ills which afflict and baffle the still larger 
American cities, and to prepare now for the 
needs of the future.” 

Robert Street was laid out at the time the 
city was established, and was only 55 feet 
in width. It is one of the chief thorough- 
fares, north and south, in the business dis- 
trict ; it is also an office building center. As 
St. Paul and also South St. Paul grew. 
traffic on this street became much con- 
gested. The property owners got together 
in 1912 and petitioned the Board of Public 
Works to widen Robert Street from 55 to 
75 feet. It was at first suggested that the 
street be arcaded on both sides, but finally 
it was decided that the cheapest, as well as 
the best, method was to widen the street 20 
feet on the west side; the buildings there 
were not as costly as those on the east side. 


[392] 


The plan adopted to meet the cost is to dis- 
tribute the expenses over the property im- 
mediately abutting on Robert Street and 
within 150 feet on the streets intersecting 
Robert Street. For financing the assess- 
ments the city has issued 6 per cent bonds, 
which the property owners affetted are to 
pay in five equal yearly instalments. 

The carrying out of the widening project 
is to cover two years. The four blocks of 
the south end, Second to Sixth Streets, were 
widened before June 1, 1914. The expense 
of doing this part of the work amounted to 
very nearly $900,000, including the value of 
the land and buildings taken and the recon- 
struction of that portion of the buildings 
torn down. At the corner of Fourth and 
Robert Streets the Merchant’s National 
Bank is now erecting a 16-story office build- 
ing to cost $1,500,000, which will be the 
tallest building in the city. 

The other section of Robert Street, from 
Sixth to Central Avenue, a distance of nine 
blocks, will be widened by June I, I9I5. 
One of the leading department stores of 
the city has already torn down its building 
at Seventh and Robert Streets and is mak- 
ing improvements on the new building laid 
at a cost of more than $500,000. A rival 
department store across the street is putting 
up a $200,000 addition. An arcade building 
will also be built at the same intersection 
of streets. 

The widening of Robert Street has given 
St. Paul its only business street of 75 feet in 
width. It has enabled the city to relieve toa 
great extent the congestion of traffic in the 
downtown district, and since it connects on 
the north end with Central Avenue, a street 
125 feet wide, it is now being used as a thor- 
oughfare to Minneapolis. The value of this 
city planning improvement for retail busi- 
ness purposes and for local and through 
traffic will undoubtedly justify its cost.

The Political Background for City Planning 


By H. S. Gilbertson 
Executive Secretary, the National Short Ballot Organization 


O a good many people, even yet, city 

a. planning suggests principally the ac- 

tivities of landscape artists: attrac- 

tive streets, shade trees, plazas, monuments 

and splashing fountains. This was the in- 

spiration of some Municipal Art Leagues 
and Municipal Art Commissions. 

About the city beautiful there can be no 
two opinions. Everybody is proud to be- 
lieve in it. Some very clever politicians 
have made it pay handsomely; it can be 
made highly pleasing to the senses, it puts 
a good deal of money into circulation, and 
gives to those in power something to point 
to as evidence of their public devotion. In 
short, besides being a most commendable 
idea in itself, it has thriven in the political 
atmosphere which has hovered about our 
cities, 

But city planning in the more modern 
sense has had a harder road to travel; its 
virtues are less obvious to the untrained 
eye. When social workers lost interest in 
symptoms and directed their attention to 
the sources of disorders, they found that 
the roots of evil went down deep into vested 
rights. Barriers had been imposed to the 
acquisition of private property ; laws unduly 
favored greedy landlords; speculators had 
been allowed to deflect the growth of the 
city into unwholesome channels. It became 
clear that a really effective program of pre- 
vention and forethought must needs find a 
leverage to remove these legal and economic 
obstacles. And such leverage has begun to 
be supplied, in part, by constitutional guar- 
antees of the right of “excess condemna- 
tion.” Taxation upon privilege, if we follow 
the single taxers, will help still further. 


Political Leverage Needed 

The need for political leverage has not 
been made so clear. And yet nothing could 
be more out of keeping with the spirit be- 
hind city planning than government whose 
faculty for determining policies is, from 
any cause, distorted or whose instruments 
of enforcement are weak and _ inefficient. 
City planning comprehends scarcely less 
than the whole of future program of public 
activities. To attempt to carry out that 
program in the political atmosphere which 


[394] 


enveloped San Francisco during the Ruef 
régime, or Pittsburgh before the institution 
of the present charter, or Cincinnati in the 
Cox period, would be to invite bankruptcy 
of hopes and resources at the start. For 
the simple needs of an older order these 
influences were intolerable; in the future 
the city’s agencies for taking thought must 
be above the slightest suggestion of cor- 
ruption, and not only corruption, but the 
lesser fruits of ill-founded government. 

These lesser fruits, what are they? City 
government in America, as we know, has 
been distinguished for the lack of a respon- 
sible, unified organization. The executive 
is usually without adequate powers of ap- 
pointment and other powers necessary to 
controlling the acts of his subordinates. 
The latter, not infrequently, have a way of 
working out policies of their own without 
reference to the plans of their colleagues 
or of their superior or to the dictates of 
public opinion. Public works under such a 
system stand in danger of being projected 
piecemeal; markets of being established 
without relation to the lines of transporta- 
tion; new streets of being opened without 
due regard to parkways; building regula- 
tions of being enacted in disregard of pub- 
lic health requirements. 

If the governing body of a city, entirely 
independent and possibly hostile to or jeal- 
ous of the executive, want to put him “in a 
hole,” they can do so freely. Without the 
slightest compunctions they may turn down 
his recommendations, however well digested 
and well conceived they might be. And 
then there are compromises, or false issues 
are raised. The best solution of the ‘par- 
ticular problem is discounted, not to meet 
candid differences of opinion, but to secure 
“harmony.” The loss to the city from fall- 
ing short of the best attainable solution is 
the price paid for an irresponsible system. 


How “Politics” May Threaten the City 
Plan 

Then there is the city whose government 

is chuck full of “politics.” -Note the out- 

come. To begin with, the campaigns for 

the election of the mayor and the govern- 

ing body of such a city are usually fought 











THE 


No matter how 
pressing may be the strictly municipal needs, 
they are rarely brought to the surface for 
intelligent discussion. So long as citizens 
are given an opportunity to split into fac- 
tions they will do it, even against a con- 
viction that national politics has no right- 
ful place in local affairs. Political leaders 
know the popular weakness and they play 
the game accordingly. And so the city 
planning program loses the very thing 
which would vitalize it—the powerful stim- 
ulus of public discussion. 


out on national party lines. 


When it comes to actual administration, 
partisanship becomes often, in plain lan- 
guage, a cloak for conspiracy against the 
interests of the whole pecple. Here is the 
alderman from Ward I. His success in 
securing a petty elective office has gone to 
his head; he at once aspires for greater 
honors and rewards—to the mayor's chair, 
or perhaps the county clerkship, or to a seat 
in the state assembly. He begins by wrap- 
ping about himself the good will of the ac- 
tive political workers in his neighborhood. 
Some of these workers, the most ardent of 
them, have more than a passing interest in 
the city hall. Not infrequently they are the 
owners of undeveloped and unmarketable 
real estate. How natural, how human for 
them, to cultivate the aspiring alderman! 

But the city plan, by the same token, is 
threatened. The property which is waiting 
to be sold to the city for the benefit of a 
loving constituent, may not fit worth a cent 
into a comprehensive plan of development. 
We have seen playgrounds Iccated in un- 
healthy and dangerous localities and quite 
out of reach of the classes they were in- 
tended to benefit. Politics explained it. 
Somewhere in the neighborhood was a con- 
stituent blessed with followers and_ bur- 
dened with unsalable realty. Trace the in- 
fluence further back, and lo! there are other 
aldermen with encumbered friendships. 
They have pooled their interests and all 
of them got something which may, or more 
likely, may not, have been according to the 
city plan. The very psychology of the local 
politician who has grown up in the ways 
of the old order runs counter to the idea 
of a broad, social, far-seeing grasp of muni- 
cipal affairs. Politicians are “practical” 
men, or they are no politicians. They are 
concerned with next November. After that 
—the deluge. 


AMERICAN 


CES 395 


Frequent Changes of Policy Fatal to the 
City Plan 

The “old style” of city government thrives 
on kaleidoscopic changes. When the term 
of elective office is but two years there is 
abundant opportunity for political activity 
Doing what? Thinking out plans of city 
betterment, attending public hearings on the 
budget? No, politics has nothing to do with 
policies. Politics in the long run means— 
jobs, not to the politician alone, but to the 
“good” citizen. Elections in cities have 
rarely been more than little revolutions— 
turning out the old, turning in the new. 
City political campaigns have seldom been 
pivoted upon a broad program of munici- 
pal development. That would have been 
bad politics; too many useful men’s toes 
would have been stepped upon. In political 
campaigns one must not talk about real is- 
sues, but about the other fellow’s iniquities. 

This kind of activity weighs heavily 
against city planning. It is not always 
given to the outsider to see the true sig- 
nificance of every move of every official 
at the city hall. Ina program of city plan- 
ning, to be achieved by a series of pro- 
gressive steps, many details, such as pre 
liminary engineering surveys, must be ob- 
scure to the citizens; their significance is 
lost upon all but the technical men. And 
yet their working out may involve a con 
siderable expense whose justification may 
only be demonstrated when the plan of 
the city is in an advanced stage of develop- 
ment. Ina highly charged political atmos 
phere these intermediate steps may easily 
and lightly be made the grounds of attack. 
not only by the “outs” but also by citizens 
who simply can’t be made to see facts in 
perspective. 

Under these circumstances the construc- 
tive elective officer, if wise, hesitates to 
enter upon an ambitious program involving 
a heavy financial outlay to the city and to 
be used to his own discredit. So that an 
essential condition of successful city plan- 
ning is a term of office suffciently long to 
carry constructive policies into effect, or at 
least within sight of completion. 


“‘Horse-Sense” Not Sufficient Qualification 
for Officials 

Finally, city planning demands expert ad- 

ministration. So long as it was the fixed 

policy of cities to confine government to

strict necessities and so long as municipal 
finance was run on the hand-to-mouth plan, 
it made comparatively little real difference 
who got elected to the positions of respon- 
sibility or who served the city in minor ca- 
pacities; none of them could do very much 
harm. The cities that secured men of 
“horse-sense” and common honesty counted 
themselves lucky. There was ample reward 
for the public officers who took the short 
view on every question that came up; in 
public health, the physician who thought of 
the cure, but not prevention of disease; in 
correction, the advocate of jails as against 
probation, education and recreation; in 
street construction, the friend of cheap, 
short-lived pavements; in finance, the man 
who was “first, last and all the time” for 
low taxes; in general administration, the 
chief executive who counted his duty done 
when he had vetoed ordinances and signed 
warrants. 

But that situation, too, has changed. The 
very idea of city planning suggests radical 
new methods all along the line; it suggests 
the study of achievements of cities in the 
past at home and abroad, the study of the 
principles underlying urban growth, the ap- 
plication of these principles in estimating 
the probable future development of a par- 
ticular city. 

Nor is this merely the function of a tem- 
porary corps of specialists. Policy making 
in every modern city is as much (or more) 
concerned with the future as with the pres- 
ent. The policies of the city must be for- 
mulated and initiated by a responsible of- 
ficial who is continuously and directly sen- 
sitive to the needs of the community and 
who, owing to a wider professional knowl- 
edge, is able to direct its aspirations into 
wise courses. 

Somewhere in the city government, in a 
place of power, there should be available a 
trained student of municipal science. Many 
cities, especially in the more recently de- 
veloped parts of the country, would have 
been saved many costly errors in every 
branch of their governments, if they had 
had at the helm some officer responsible for 
bringing to the surface the experience of 
older communities that had long since 
solved the problem in hand. Cities under 
such a régime would cease imitating the 
mistakes and compromises of their exem- 
plars. 


That this function can hardly be filled by 
the usual elective chief executive goes 
without saying. The number of mayors of 
big vision which America to date has pro- 
duced in its hundreds of cities could prob- 
ably be counted on the fingers of two hands. 
Successful business men have repeatedly 
been elected to executive office, only to find 
themselves temperamentally and by train- 
ing unfit to lead or even to interpret public 
opinion; lawyers and other professional 
men have been no more successful. 


How to Secure Proper “City Planning” 
Government 

Responsibility, freedom from _ politics, 
continuity of policy and expert administra- 
tion—it is an ambitious program. “Old- 
style” city government, with its ingenious 
checks and balances, its concessions to the 
district politician, its commitment to the 
spoils theory, its glorification of incompe- 
tence, offers little hope. City planning, if it 
is to go to the heart of the city problem, 
needs the appropriate political background. 
How can it be obtained? 

The answer is simple enough in principle. 

Responsibility in administration is attain- 
able through a simplified, flexible organiza- 
tion which answers to the call of a single 
directing head, the kind of organization 
every city would have adopted had it not 
been sheered off from its natural course to 
follow unsound and untried political doc- 
trines. 

Freedom from politics is attainable when 
the form of government is so simple that 
the professional politician is no longer 
needed and every citizen can handle his own 
civic job. 

Continuity of policy would follow as a 
normal result when the equality of citizens 
was thus established. 

Expert administration would come in 
general government, as it has in education, 
when the rewards of mediocrity and incom- 
petence were abolished and public opinion 
was released to take its natural course. 


The Movement is Well Started 

These principles have actually been put 
into effect in several American cities. Day- 
ton and Springfield, Ohio, Cadillac and 
Manistee, Mich., are among the number. 
The unification of the powers of the city 
in a single elective body has established 
responsibility for the exercising of those 








THE AMERICAN CITY 397 


powers. The executive and administrative 
branch of the government has been made 
the instrument of the governing body in 
stead of a jealous rival. The chief execu 
tive—the city manager—has been selected 
by non-political, accurate appraisal of his 
fitness without reference to residence. The 
ballot has been made non-partisan. The 
number of officers elected at any one time 
has been reduced to the point where poli- 
ticians are no longer needed. Freedom 
from politics promises to do away with 


useless dismissal of capable elective ser- 


because there is no great mercenar\ 


vants, 
gain in changes, and thus to promote a 
stable, continuous administrative personnel 
the term of office has been lengthened to 
four years. 

These cities realized that big work lay 
before them. ‘he old machinery broke 
down. New responsibilities called for new 
and better instruments. In meeting thos« 
responsibilities by adopting a modernized 
simplified form of government, they ac 
quired the proper political background 
a city planning program 





The Dubuque Athletic Field 


By J. H. Spencer 


UBUQUE, lowa, claims the distine- 
tion of constructing the first impoit- 
ant municipal athletic park in this 

country. Ofhcially, the park is called the 
Dubuque Athletic Field. It was begun in 
the fall of 1913 and was dedicated in 
April, 1914. 

Che park is only a few blocks from the 
business center of the city. In the early 
days the site was a slough, partly filled with 
sawdust when lumbering was the principal 
industry of Dubuque. The location is ideal, 
but it took a man of vision to see that this 
old slough could

park. This man is one of Dubuque’s promi

vate subscription most of the money needed 
for immediate improvements. The city 
also donated $2,500 to help along the 
project.

THE BASEBALL FIELD BECOMES AN ICE RINK IN WINTER 





























A PUBLIC CELEBRATION NEAR THE LAKI 


IN FOX MEMORIAL PARK, LA 


POR 


A Memorial Park for the People 
By C. B. Huntress 


Secretary of the La Porte Chamber of Commerce 


N La Porte, Ind., a city of 16,000, situated 
59 miles east of Chicago, is located one 
of the most beautiful parks in the Cen- 

tral West, adorned with a large number of 
great oaks and hickories, varieties of trees 
which are not common in this section. 

Fox Memorial Park represents an in- 
vestment of $50,000, and its establishment 
has resulted in the expenditure of not less 
than $50,000 for boulevards leading through 
the park and to the city, a distance of less 
than a mile. It contains approximately 25 
acres, situated along the north shore of 
Clear Lake, a very attractive body of water. 
From the park casino there is a fine view 
of the city. 

The park has been open to the public for 
nearly two years. The dedicatory exercises 
were held on June 26, 1913, when the Hon. 
James Eli Watson, former Republican 
leader of the House of Representatives, ex- 
pressed, in behalf of Messrs. Maurice, Her- 
bert, Robert, Walter and Norman Fox, the

for the big oaks, six feet in diameter, the

ing several varieties of sumac and wild 
crab-apple. Shrubs and perennials of 85 
varieties and to the number of 11,500 were 
planted on the grounds. 

rhe buildings comprise a spacious casino, 
where refreshments are served in the even- 
ing, pergolas, which are beautified by vines, 
a band-stand and a large comfort station. 
The park grounds are brilliantly illumi- 
nated. The casino is lighted by 12 I00- 
watt lamps, the pergolas by 56 60-watt 
lamps, and the band-stand by 12 60-watt 
lamps. There are 36 posts with 250-watt

lamps on the ground. These posts are of 
reinforced concrete, the design of Myron 
H. West, formerly superintendent of Lin- 
coln Park, Chicago. 

The 25 acres of the park are largely of 
rolling prairie land, most suitable for park 
purposes. The band-stand is in the hollow 
of a natural amphitheatre. The park 
grounds present a beautiful picture on a 
band-concert evening—scores of automo- 
biles parked along the wide boulevard, hun- 
dreds of people seated on the grassy slopes 
around the band-stand, children romping 
and playing, row-boats and canoes crossing 
and recrossing in the changing shadows, 
lights everywhere, and the music the cen- 
tral feature in a perfect setting. 





Municipal Concerts in an Amphitheatrical Park 
By R. Bedichek 


Secretary, Austin Young Men’s Business Club 


HERE’S a little thousand-dollar park, 
T comprising but a block, in the cen- 
ter of a rather exclusive residential 
district of Austin, Texas. It is a sort of 
auditorium, playground and social center 
all combined ; at one time a political forum, 
at another a stage for some church festival, 
at another a playground for throngs of 
children, or a meeting place for thousands 
of music lovers to hear free municipal con- 
certs, 

For seventy-one years this plot of ground 
was an unsightly plague-spot in the heart 
of a beautiful residence district. It was a 
dumping-ground for tin cans and other rub- 
bish, and two springs in wet seasons con- 
verted the floor of the ravine traversing it 
into a mosquito-breeding marsh. An in- 
telligent administration, by the investment 
of $1,000 in 1910 and later, metamorphosed 
this ragged piece of landscape into a thing 
of beauty; and a keeper at $60 per month 
and the expenditure of $250 per year for 
incidentals, keep it a joy forever. 

Mayor Wooldridge went about this work 
gradually, building up the soil with street 
sweepings and the rich dirt of excavations, 
weeding out a tree here, and trimming one 
up there, accommodating the serpentine 
walk to the natural lay of the land; in short, 
he let this park grow along the line of least 


resistance. A band-stand of classic design, 
serving also as a sort of arch over the small 
stream now confined to a concrete runway, 
adorns the center of the park, carrying out 
the amphitheatre scheme. The acoustics 
are so nearly perfect that a very ordinary 
speaker can be heard by 8,000 people—in- 
deed, the slopes as nature left them could 
not be better adapted to banking auditors 
comfortably and compactly. 

Of course, the $1,000 mentioned above 
does not include the expense of laying side- 
walks, curbing and parking around the 
block, but that expense is chargeable to 
street improvement, anyway. And besides 
this, the residents of that district began to 
take so much pride in the park as they wit- 
nessed the gradual metamorphosis, that they 
raised by private subscription enough 
money to construct the band-stand, install 
an ornamental light or two, and stick in a 
few other minor adornments. 

By far the most important use of this park 
is for free municipal musical entertainments. 
No great sum is appropriated to bring 
world-renowned artists to the city, or to 
keep high-class musical organizations con- 
stantly on the payroll. It is rather a home 
affair. Two men, whose musical taste is 
beyond reproach, and who are themselves 
accomplished musicians, are given the au- 


























WOOLDRIDGE PARK, AUSTIN, 


thority to assemble a municipal band out 
of the best musical talent in the city. Each 
entertainment costs only about $60. Two 
concerts per week will be given throughout 
the present summer. . 
There was considerable opposition to 
these concerts in 1911; the council gave 


grudgingly, and by only a bare majority, 


$500 for this purpose. There was appro- 
priated $600 with a little freer hand the 
next year; no Opposition was made to ap- 
propriating $1,000 in 1913, and last year a

Jones Park, East St. Louis, III. 
By Tampton Aubuchon 


HE East St. Louis Park District, a 
municipality embracing the city of 
Kast St. Louis, Ill, was created 
by a special act of the Illinois Legisla- 
ture in 1908, and was given power to levy 
and collect taxes for the purpose of prov id- 
ing and maintaining a system of parks and 
ulevards throughout the district. Since 
its inception the Park Board has established 
several small parks and playgrounds of the 
city block size and has made great head- 
way on the construction of boulevards, but 
the most creditable work is the new Jones 
Park, opened in June, 1914, by a monster 
union school picnic, attended by 25,000 peo- 
ple. The Park District is governed by a 
Board of Trustees, elected for four years, 
who serve without pay. The Board appoints 
a secretary, an engineering corps, park 
police and a general superintendent. 
Jones Park was built at a cost of $75,000, 
including the purchase price of the ground

sion being made for the travel of vehicles.

injected at the bottom of the pool, which 
keeps the lower water agitated and causes 
the sediment to come to the surface, where 
it finds its way to the overflow. Arrange- 
ments have been made for water polo meets 
and swimming races. 

\ concrete grand stand, seating 1,000 
people, facing a quarter-mile track, was 
built at a cost of $10,000. The track is 
25 feet wide with a 200-yard straight-away. 
The center area of the track immediately 
in front of the grand stand is used for 
baseball and football. Beneath the grand 
stand are lockers and shower baths for 
athletes of both sexes. 

Seven acres are devoted to tennis courts. 
There is a general playground suitable for 
the entertainment of people of all ages. 
Swings, toboggan slides, sand piles, croquet 
grounds, courts for horseshoes and quoits 
are among the playground facilities. 

Although the park contains 150 benches 
and a large number of box swings and 
rope swings, $17,000 was spent on a two- 
story rest house. The rest house is built 
of fire bricks and is architecturally attrac- 
tive. The lower floor contains toilet rooms 
and drinking fountains. The upper floor is 
a covered pavilion overlooking a grove. 
€omfortable chairs and settees are placed 
in this section, and provision is made for 
hand concerts. Ladies’ literary and sewing 
societies are urged to use this section for 
their meeting place. The fortunate loca- 
tion of the rest house enables mothers to 
enjoy their sewing or reading while the 
children are romping in the grove.

The Stay-in-School Campaign in New Orleans 


By J. M. Gwinn 


Superintendent of Public Schools, New Orleans, La. 


HE New Orleans Board of Education 
has devoted much attention during 
the last four years to the important 

subject of influencing the children in the 
public schools of that city to remain longer 
in school. 

he movement crystallized in the week 
beginning January 18, I915, in an active, 
general campaign, with the following 
objects: 

“(1) To discover and retain for the schools 
the children who are being eliminated for any 
cause; (2) to stimulate and increase interest 
and secure greater cooperation on the part of 
parents and pupils in the matter of prolonging 
school life; (3) to secure the active coOpera- 
tion of the press and of prominent citizens who 
may act as speakers at schoolhouse meetings 
during that week; (4) to unify and utilize in 
this definite, specific undertaking (to lessen 
elimination) the efforts of our various civic 
organizations, such as the Public School Al- 
liance, Parents’ Codperative Clubs, the Presi- 
dents’ Codperative Club, the New Orleans 
Educational Association and alumnz associa- 
tions of the high and normal schools, the Asso- 
ciation of Commerce, and the Board of Trade.” 

Following this action of the Board, a 
meeting at which several of the heads of 
the organizations named above and many 
representative citizens were present, was 
held for the purpose of planning the cam- 
paign. A corps of speakers was elected, 
and it was decided to hold one meeting in 
each grammar school for the grammar 
grade pupils and one meeting for the 
parents and patrons in each of these 
schools, also a meeting in each of the high 
schools for pupils in those schools, in order 
to afford the students an opportunity of 
hearing arguments in favor of remaining in 
school sufficiently long to acquire the train- 
ing necessary for a successful life. The 
corps of speakers included 120 different 
persons. The seventh and eighth grade 
pupils were invited to visit their respective 
high schools on one of the days during 
campaign week to acquaint themselves with 
the opportunities offered in those schools. 

During the week following the campaign, 
a request for information concerning the 
results of the campaign was sent to the 
principal in each school. These reports re- 
vealed that 92 eighth-A pupils who had 


(404) 


decided not to go to high school had en- 
tered those schools; 63 of those gcing to 
the high schools decided to take the longer 
rather than the shorter courses; 98 pupils 
who had decided to leave school in the near 
future altered their decision, and 22; 
parents were reported to have definitely 
decided to keep their children in school 
longer than had been their expectation. 

The following suggestions with refer- 
ence to further campaigns and to ways in 
which they should be followed up were 
secured from some of the principals: 

1. Have a campaign each term and earlier in 
the term. 
», Send printed circulars giving reasons for 


more education and information about the high 
schools to the parents of all children. 

3. Teachers and principals should make talks 
in classrooms upon the necessity of education. 

4. Supply free text books. 

5. Make school life more attractive by fur- 
nishing larger playgrounds. 

6. Teachers and principals should have per- 
sonal interviews with parents. 

7. More industrial work. 

8. Experienced grammar grade teachers and 
vocational guidance instruction given in the 
grammar grades. 

9. Parents’ Clubs should take up the work 
as a special activity. 

10. Rigid enforcement of the school attend- 
ance law. 

11. A fund to provide poor children with 
needed clothing, books, etc. 

12. Create a permanent Stay-in-School Citi- 
zens’ Committee, made up of three citizens 
from each school district. 

13. Direct attention of pupils to vocational 
subjects through composition work in connec- 
tion with English. 


Close codperation and a more sympa- 
thetic understanding between the grammar 
schools and high schools are also recom- 
mended. High school principals should 
often visit the grammar schools, converse 
with the pupils in those schools and confer 
with their principals. Principals of gram- 
mar schools should in like manner visit the 
high schools’ It is important that there 
be also the closest codperation between the 
departmental teachers in the grammar 
grades and the teachers of similar subjects 
in the high schools, in order that perfect 
coordination may exist in the work of these 
departments as the pupils advance in their 
studies. 


























THE MUNICIPAL ICE 


PLANT IN 





FERNANDINA, FLA. 


Progress in the Municipal Ownership and 
Operation of Ice Plants 
By Jeanie Wells Wentworth 


Department of Public Works, City of New York 


HE municipal ownership and operation 
of public utilities continues to 
broaden in scope and purpose. Since 
my report on “Municipal Ice Plants’ was 
compiled for the President of the Borough 
of Manhattan, much additional information 
has come to light which shows continued in- 
terest in and progressive development of 
such undertakings. 

At the time the report was published, now 
a little more than a year ago, the only mu- 
nicipal ice plant that could be found in op- 
eration in the United States was in Weath- 
erford, Okla. Now activities are reported 
all along the line. 

The plant in Weatherford continues to 
make According to the report for 
the 1913, made by Public Utilities 
Commissioner Hugh J]. Cooper, who is god- 
father to the plant, the total receipts were 


good.

$4,628.55; expenses, divided between de- 
livery expense, $1,103.70, and plant ex- 


pense, $1,033.49, making a total expense of 
$2,137.19. This gives a net profit of 
$2,491.36, or over 50 per cent. Weatherford 
sells its ice direct to the people, at from 40 
cents per 100 pounds in small quantities, to 


car- 
An ice-making machine of the 
and the 
production is approximately 50 
ton. 

lhe figures for 1914 show a continued 
improvement, as interestingly told in the 
following extract from a letter just received 
from the Commissioner : 

“Our total figures for the calendar year of 
1914 show our total receipts for ice sold to be 
$5,568.79, our total disbursements from ice 
fund to be $3,244.49 

“Our disbursements are divided as follows 

Cost of delivery...... $1,137.45 
Cost of manufacture. . 2,021.39 
\dditions and betterments. 85.65 


about 15 cents per hundredweight in 
load lots.

“Our ice plant is operated in connection with 
the water and light plant, the same boilers 
operating both plants, and the work in bot! 
plants being done by the same help. As a con 
sequence, it is difficult to make an accurate 
division of the expense. Our ice plant makes 
a nice profit each year, while the other plants 
barely pay operating expenses on account ol! 
free service rendered and a lower rate to our 
people than is really justifiable. For the above 
reasons I am inclined to charge against the ice 
plant considerably more than its just pro- 
portion of the expense. For instance, I charge 
the salary of one engineer to the ice plant for 


[406] 























406 THE AMEI 


the entire year, while the number of engineers 
employed and salaries paid are the same as 
they were before we added the ice plant.” 

During the past year word has come from 
several localities of a lively interest in the 
question. In Kansas, the League of Kan 
sas Municipalities is actively at work, and 
citizens and public officials in the various 
cities are strongly in favor of the project 
Phe actual establishment of such plants has 
been delayed, however, by an adverse ruling 
of the Attorney-General, who, in spite of 
the fact that in Kansas very broad munici- 
pal ownership powers are given, has ruled 
that cities do not possess the specific power 
to establish and operate ice plants. There 
is a movement in progress to obtain that 
specific power from the Legislature 

On April 27, 1914, the City Council of 
Chicago requested the Corporation Counsel 
to render an opinion as to the power of that 
city to install and operate ice plants. In his 
reply the Corporation Counsel referred to 
his opinion rendered the year previous, to 
the effect that cities in Illinois have not the 
power to own and operate ice plants, but 
further stated that that power might be 
given to Chicago by an amendment to the 
Cities and Villages Act. In accordance with 
this opinion the following amendment, em- 
bodying additional powers, has been pre 
pared for submission to the state Legisla- 
ture: 

“To establish markets and market houses, 
and provide for the regulation and use thereof ; 
to erect, or acquire by purchase, condemnation 
or otherwise, ice houses and ice-making plants, 
and do all things necessary or expedient to 
supply the inhabitants of the city or village 
with ice.” 

The state Legislature of Florida has 
authorized the town of Mayo, in Lafayette 
County, to issue bonds in the amount of 
$15,000, “for the purpose of establishing, 
building and maintaining an ice plant and 
an electric light plant.” 

In the summer of 1913, the city of New 
sritain, Conn., appointed a committee to 
look into the matter, which they did with 
great thoroughness, and reported in favor 
of a municipal ice plant to be supplied by 
harvesting natural ice. This, they claimed, 
would be cheaper, because of natural ad- 
vantages, than the manufacture of ice. 

Upon receipt of this favorable report the 
people lost no time in getting to work. The 
Common Council voted $10,000 for the pur- 
pose, and a building was erected 175 feet 


> 
\ 


[1CAN £479 


long, 50 feet wide by 30 feet high, having a 
capacity of 7,700 tons, The building is 
equipped with the very best conveyors and 
unloading machines. Apparently the ex- 
pectation of economy has been realized. A 
ommunication from the Mayor gives the 
cost of production per ton at the very low 
firure of 22 cents. Ina recent letter, Theo- 
dore Wagner, Chairman of the committee, 
makes the following statement: 

[he Ice Committee can say that they have 
saved every family using ice a certain amount, 
besides which we have been paying for the 
uilding of roads to the ice house, for store- 

uses in the city for storing ice, sawdust, 
hay and cinders, all out of the earnings; be- 
sides we will have more than enough money 
to fill the ice house with a new crop next 
winter. The city of New Britain consumes 


} 


about 30,000 tons of ice. With our 7,000 tons 
we were able to control prices. The city for 
this first year has sold to private distributors 
for $1.25 per ton at the ice house; $2.00 
per ton at the storehouse in the city. 
The peddlers were compelled to deliver ice to 
small consumers at the rate of 30 cents per 
hundred, or 33 pounds for 10 cents. Other 
dealers were compelled to do the same. In 
this manner we have been able to regulate the 
price.” 

In the summer of 1913 the little town 

f Lafayette, Ala., put into operation a mu- 
nicipal ice plant which is doing a flourishing 
business. The plant is a modern brick struc- 
ture, with Wolf ice-making -equipment, 
costing $10,000 to erect. The capacity of 
the plant is about 10 tons of ice daily. The 
entire output is sold direct to consumers at 
about 40 cents per hundredweight. The re- 
ceipts in the ice department run from $40 
to $60 daily. No money is received at the 
plant or by wagons. Instead, ice books are 
sold for from $1 to $5 at the office of the 
City Clerk. 

his ice plant is operated in conjunction 
with the electric light and water plant. The 
expenses for the entire plant per month are 
$260. For the month of May, 1914, the re- 
ceipts in canceled coupons or ice tickets 
were $516. 

The record of this little plant certainly 
indicates that a municipal ice plant can be 
made profitable and at the same time give 
the consumer good ice at a reasonable rate. 
Like any other business proposition it can 
be made a success if business methods are 
used. 

The city of Fernandina, Fla., also oper- 
ates an ice plant in connection with its 
water and light plant. Some interesting 
data concerning this undertaking are fur-

idditional fuel consumption of 1 tons of 
coal lhe selling of ice was started June 8

Before the installation of this plant the 
price of ice was 6 pounds for 5 cents; a 
200-pound block for 80 cents; and other 
prices from $6 to $8 per ton. The present 
prices, as fixed by the city of Fernandina,

cost about $60,000, the building and other 
items about $20,000. The plant capacity is 
10 tons per hour. The cost of production is 
60 cents per ton. The entire output is sold 
under a ten-year contract to a distributing 
agent ata profit to the plant of 50 cents pet 
ton, or about 85 per cent. 

The city of New York has made strenu- 
ous efforts, from time to time, to go into 
the ice business, beginning as far back as 
1905. In 1907 a bill was introduced into the 
Legislature to authorize a $1,000,000 cor- 
porate stock issue for the purpose of estab- 
lishing an ice plant in each of the bor- 
oughs. The bill slept in committee. At the 
same time that this bill was presented to the 
Legislature, Borough President Bird S 
Coler appeared before the Board of Esti- 
mate and Apportionment of New York City, 
asking for an appropriation of $125,000 to 
build a 125-ton ice plant in the Borough of 
Brooklyn. The request was denied on the 
opinion of the Corporation Counsel that the 
city had no authority to undertake this 
work. 

In 1913 the state Legislature passed a 
“home rule” bill which overcame this dis- 


ability, and the question again came to the

THE 


410 


The city of Cleveland has recently estab- 
lished a municipal electric light plant, and 
sells the current for 3 cents per kilowatt- 
hour, but it has no ice plant in conjunction 
with this plant. It has, however, a first- 
class refrigeration plant in its new munici- 
pal market, which not only supplies refrig- 
eration for the market men but also rents 
cold storage space to commission merchants 
and to householders. This last is a most ap 
pealing feature. If the practice were more 
general it would become a great factor in 
reducing prices. Any Cleveland housewife 
may buy provisions at the plentiful season 
and store them there at a nominal cost for 
subsequent use when prices are high and 
food speculators are working overtime. For 
instance : 

A crate of eggs, containing 30 dozen, may 
be stored from April 1 to January |

AMERICAN 


Cree 


Recently, Mr. George W. Perkins, Chair- 
man of Mayor Mitchel’s Food Supply Com- 
mittee, recommended that New York City 
establish a municipal cold storage plant, and 
called attention to the facts that terminal 
facilities and markets cannot be made ef- 
ficient without cold storage facilities and 
that the privately owned cold storage facili- 
ties in and around New York are not ade- 
quate for present-day needs. He said: 
“At this time there is not an inch of avail- 
able cold storage space to be had in Greater 


New York or Jersey City.” 
Here, then, is an opportunity and a need 
for the municipality to establish cold 


storage plants, not only for dealers, but to 
provide space for householders also. They 
could well be maintained by the use of the 
exhaust steam from many of our public 
buildings, which now goes to waste. If 
operated in this way, the cost of main- 
tenance would be so small that the plants 
would become a source of much revenue to 
the city and would at the same time afford 
the housewives of New York an opportu- 
nity to effect practical savings in their 
household budgets. 





Wind-Bracing Requirements 


How 120 American cities specify wind 
pressure for the design of buildings is dis- 
cussed in an article by R. Fleming, of the 
American Bridge Compariy, of New York, 
in Engineering News for March 11, 1915. 
The writer's conclusions are summarized 
by him as follows: 


“It might seem that our American munici- 
palities have exhausted the combinations of 
wind pressure and wind stress that can be 
made. The fact that one code differs from an- 
other is not in itself a cause for criticism, but 
a code is decidedly at fault when it contains 
absurd or needless requirements or when its 
requiremenis are not clearly expressed. To 
assume wind pressure over a large area at 30 
pounds per square foot, and then to add the 
sectional area necessary to resist wind stresses 
to that required for live and dead loads, is 
needless. Where this is specified in a code 
it is evaded in practice. It would be far better 
to make rational assumptions and insist on a 
rigid adherence to them than to insert in a 
code improbable loadings or working stresses 
that will be ignored in actual construction. 


in Municipal Building Codes 


“That the neeed of revision in our building 
codes is being felt by the public is evidenced 
by the number now being revised. Although 
our knowledge of wind action is limited, we 
should be able to come nearer to a common 
ground of requirement for wind bracing than 
we have at present. As a basis for uniformity 
the writer suggests the building ordinances of 
Chicago. The paragraph on Wind Resistance 
reads: 

‘All buildings shall be designed to 
resist a horizontal wind pressure of 
20 pounds per square foot tor every 
square foot of exposed surface. In no 
case shall the overturning moment due 
to wind pressure exceed 75 per cent of 
the moment of stability of the building 
due to the dead load only.’ 

“The paragraph relating to Wind Stress 
reads: 

‘For stress produced by wind forces 
combined with those from live and 
dead loads, the unit-stress may be in- 
creased 50 per cent over those given 
above; but the section shall not be 


less than required if wind forces be 
neglected.’ ” 

















Why Women Should Study Town Ordinances 
and Town Budgets 


By Maud van Buren 


N my article on “Women and Town 
Improvement” in the February number 
of THe AMERICAN City, I attempted to 

show the necessity of a knowledge on the 
part of women not only of surface condi 
tions, but of the local laws and the local 
budget, before leaping headlong into local 
improvement. There are two main rea- 
sons for a close study of the ordinances 
and the distribution of the public funds: 
(1) to insure intelligent service, and (2) to 
gain the respect and confidence of that 
body of citizens with whom there must be 
a close codperation for the best practical 
results. 

A systematic study of local ordinances 
has been undertaken by certain clubs with 
eminent success. Some of these clubs, feel- 
ing the need of a more general knowledge 
on the part of all women in the com- 
munity, have distributed among house- 
keepers printed pamphlets containing 
those ordinances most closely affecting the 
home and the family. The Sioux City 
(Iowa) Woman's Club, for example, com- 
piled in 1913 a small pamphlet entitled 
“City Ordinances We Should Know and 
With Which We Should Comply.” The 
pamphlet is attractive in form and does not 
defeat its object by too bulky text—a mat- 
ter of considerable importance where busy 
housewives are concerned. 


The following 
local ordinances 


are considered: cruelty 
to animals; billboards; protection from fire ; 
firearms; food and milk inspection; gar- 
bage; hack, express and automobile hire; 
ice ; injury to property ; licenses; medicines, 
etc., samples; milk and cream dealers; 
minors; numbering houses; quarantine reg- 


ulations; shows, vulgar and immoral; slot 
machines; regulation of speed; spitting; 


street car fare; streets, alleys and sewers; 
setting out of trees; tuberculosis; cutting 
of weeds; weights and measures. .In some 
communities others might well be added— 
for example, building and factory inspec- 
tion; smoke inspection; registry of births, 
etc.—all those ordinances that have to do 
with family health, family morals and 
family ethics. 


A civic organization of women cannot 
look for the best until these sim 
plest laws are understood and acted upon 
Insistence, by women, of the enforcement 


results 


of all these local laws is not meant to em- 
hbarrass the council nor the policemen nor 
other officials. Their enforcement 
means not merely the getting of one’s dues; 
it has an ethical value especially to the 
young. Young America is naturally none 
too considerate of law, and this is hardly to 
be wondered at when city officials are them- 
selves so remiss in their observance of the 
very laws that they help to frame. 

To press an example, let us consider just 
one—the 


city 


spitting ordinance. Very few 
towns are without a spitting ordinance. One 
is so accustomed to bold-faced placards 
threatening dire punishment for spitting on 
sidewalks and in public places that one 
rarely notices them any more; and yet, in 
how many communities has either fine or 
imprisonment been meted out to even the 
chronic offender? The fact 
amusing if it were not so sad 


would be 
a travesty 
on justice that in our town halls and county 
courthouses, our “halls of justice,” the dis- 
regard of this law is most flagrant. Now 
women seeking to do their part in the busi- 
ness of municipal housekeeping cannot af- 
ford to quarrel with the officer who spits 
in public places—perhaps he is to be rather 
pitied than blamed for so vile a habit—but 
if officials can’t or won't enforce a law, we 
are perfectly justified in asking for its re- 
peal. Such a law unenforced has an in 
finitely more deplorable effect upon the 
young of a community than no such law at 
all. After the example set by the home and 
the school, surely we should look to the 
city for further inspiration. What a city’s 
influence shall be in making its boys and 
girls good American citizens depends not 
so much upon the number and the kind of 
its ordinances as upon their observance and 
enforcement by those in authority. It be 
hooves women, then, to look into these or- 
dinances not so much for what they, per- 
sonally, can get out of them as for what 
they can put into them for the sake of a 
better future citizenship.

412 THE AMERICAN CITY 


The budget is not so simple a matter. 
The term “budget” is not so familiar as 
either “law” or “ordinance.” Indeed many 
voters, themselves, scarcely understand its 
meaning and fewer give it any thought 
One hears considerable growling at assess 
ment time about exorbitant taxes, but only 
the wise man or woman goes any farther 
than to pay them obediently but reluctantly. 
When women wake up to a sense of their 
responsibility in these matters, they will de- 
mand not only a systematized municipal 
budget but that the taxpayers be taken into 
the confidence of the budget makers. 

Most women know now where our public 
revenues come from, but do we know what 
we should know of their appropriation? 
Are we sure that our greatest local needs 
are being met by them? When we give it 
any thought at all, aren’t we conscious 
sometimes of a poorly balanced system? 
Are not our local curative measures receiv- 
ing altogether too large a proportion of our 
public funds, as compared with preventive 
measures? Our city may have many miles 
of paving and a “great white way,” while 


garbage and stable refuse piled deep in 
backyards and alleys testify to negligence 
along sanitary lines on the part of public 
officials. Have we investigated the cost and 
benefits of an incinerator and a regularly 
established system of garbage collection ? 
What is the expense to the community of 
the police department, as compared: with the 
cost of a public gymnasium and swimming 
pool to offset the vicious influences that 
make a police force necessary? What 
would be the cost of the absolute elimina- 
tion of the fly, as compared with the ex- 
pense of a typhoid epidemic ? 

The budget may be a dry-looking thing 
in the black and white of the local paper, 
but it is a significant thing. Its working 
out involves a knowledge of the vital needs 
of the community, discrimination between 
essentials and non-essentials, judgment as 
to comparative values and enthusiasm for 
local betterment. The budget, the city’s 
financial measures for each year, is surely 
not beyond the comprehension of the woman 
who conducts her own household expenses 
on a systematized basis. 





A Sand-Pile Makes a Good Starter for a 
Playground 


You can afford at least a sand-pile. 

Try to get the best quality of sand, the 
best wooden or cement bins. 

Try to have two sets of sand bins to be 
used alternately. While 
one is in use let the sun, 
rain, wind and attendants 
purify the other. 

Locate the sand piles 
under shade trees, if pos- 
sible. If not, removable 
awnings or wooden shel- 
ters should protect the 
children from sun and 
rain. 

There should be one 
moist sand-pile and one 
pile of dry seashore sand. 

See that bottom of sand- 
pile is well drained. Don’t 
let the pile lie unused for 
several days after a heavy 
rain. 

Try to have small indi- 





vidual sand bins and one large sand-pile. 

Shovels, pails, shingles, pebbles, etc., 
should be the tools provided for play. 

Shovels should be large galvanized iron 
spoons. 

Cover the sand-pile at 
night. 

Sand purifies itself—it 
is necessary only to free 
it from refuse and scraps. 

Sprinkling the sand 
with a thin solution of 
bichloride of mercury will 
insure against fleas. 

Sand that had _ been 
used constantly for three 
months was analyzed by a 
Chicago chemist and 
found to be free from 
dangerous bacteria.—

zenship” Bulletin of the 
New York Bureau of Mu- 
nicipal Research.

Cleaning Up 

There is evidence that the “clean-up” 
movement is even more popular this spring 
than it was last year. There are echoes all 
over the country of people cleaning their 
homes generally, including the cellars, at- 
tics and stables, in which disinfectants are 
freely used. They are using paint upon 
everything that needs it, and are raking up 
leaves and burning them and all other burn- 
able trash. They are planning to make 
their front yards groan under flower beds 
and their back yards sprout with vegetables, 
the seeds in many cases given free. They 
are planting and trimming shrubs, hedges, 
trees and vines; are cleaning up and beauti- 
fying vacant lots by removing the unsightly 
weeds, tin cans and other rubbish. They are 
attempting to abolish all places that might 
breed flies and mosquitoes. Streets and 
alleys are being made to shine—trash re- 
ceptacles are being installed upon the streets

A Commercial Awakening in 
Philadelphia 

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—The many arteries 
of the Quaker City have had an infusion 
of red corpuscle-forming fluid and a con- 
sequent quickening of the pulse through 
the campaign for new members just com- 
pleted by the Town Development Com- 
pany for the Greater Chamber of Com- 
merce. After nine days of soliciting, the 
membership was increased to 4,242, with 
dues at $25 a year, pledged for three years, 
thus insuring a working capital of $100,000 
annually for three years. With the in- 
creased income, a broader program of 
work than formerly, industrially and civic- 
ally, is planned for Philadelphia. 

The revitalized body plans, among other 
things, to provide an auditorium in connec- 
tion with its present building, in which 











THE 


meetings of the members may be held. The 
program of work to be taken up immedi- 
ately includes a Traffic Bureau, an Indus- 
trial Bureau, a Trade and Commerce Bu 
reau, a Foreign Trade Bureau, a Legis 
lative and Taxation Bureau, a Publicity and 
Convention Bureau, a Civic Bureau and a 
Charities Bureau.

A Good Roads Bond Issue 
Denison, TEx.—The Denison: Chamber 


of Commerce is indirectly responsible for 
the $900,000 road bond issue recently voted, 
with which to build 225 miles of macadam 
and gravel roads in and around Grayson 
County. The bond issue involves a tax of 
15 cents on $100 of taxable property and 
the bonds run for forty years at 5 per cent. 

In 1909 the Denison Chamber of 
merce secured an issue of $250,000 of bonds 


Com 


to build 50 miles of water-bound macadam 
roads in the immediate vicinity. The good 
roads in the Denison district attracted th 
attention of the residents of Sherman and 
the surrounding territory, and another issue 
of bonds amounting to $400,000 resulted, 
with which 70 miles of gravel roads adjoin- 
ing the Denison district were built, giving 
Grayson County 120 miles of good roads. 
Other sections of the county observed the 
advantages resulting from the good road- 
ways in the two above-mentioned districts, 
where property values had advanced and 
the efficiency of the farms had been in- 


AMERICAN 


Cris 415 


and initiated the 
which the above-mentioned 


creased, movement by 
$900,000 bond 
issue was voted for a county system of im- 
proved highways. 

The plan contemplates a complete belt 
road 100 miles in length, connecting the 
various border and communities, 
through a black, waxy strip of country 
where during wet weather the country dirt 
roads are almost impassable and the farm 


towns 


ers are greatly hampered in marketing their 

products. There will also be 

laterals through the county, touching the 

sections not served by the belt line and con 

necting the two existing district 
\ 


125 miles of 


systems, 
which will give the county 345 miles of con 
nected macadam and gravel roads at a total 
cost of $1,550,000. 

The highways will be so located that a 
road will penetrate every community in the 
county, and thus very greatly reduce the 
cost of marketing farm products and facili- 
tate transportation generally. Provision for 
the maintenance of the 
structed and of 


roads to be con 
already 
made possible by creating the fund through 
taxation. 

A view of one of the good roads in the 
county is here shown.

A City Advertising Act 


ALLIANCE, Nes.—The Commercial Club 
of Alliance has succeeded in having an act 
passed, with an amendment submitting the 
proposition to the people, two-thirds major- 
ity carrying, empowering cities of the first 
class in Nebraska (between 5,000 and 25, 
000 population) to levy a tax of not more 
than five mills annually on all taxable prop- 
erty within the city, for the purpose of 
“creating a fund for advertising the city’s 
possibilities and advantages as a location 
for homes, factories and other legitimate 
enterprises.” The levy for the advertising 
fund, as it is called, is to be made at the 
same time as the levy for general fund 
purposes. 

The act provides that the levy may com- 
mence after fifty or more residents of a city 
shall have organized themselves into a so- 
ciety for the improvement of the city and 
for the purpose of advertising its advan- 
tages as a location for homes, factories, etc., 
and shall have adopted a constitution and 
by-laws ‘setting forth such purpose, and 
after-the society shall have raised and paid 
into its treasury by subscriptions or dues 
imposed upon its members not less than 
$500. in each year. Upon the president of 
such society certifying to the City Clerk 
the existence of the organization and the 
amount thus paid, the Mayor and City 
Council will designate the society the Ad- 


vertising Board for the city, which may then 
proceed to disburse its funds for the pur- 
pose for which they were raised and aug- 
ment and maintain them by the levy above 
mentioned. The funds are to be paid out 
by the City Treasurer upon warrants drawn 
and signed by the president and secretary 
of the Advertising Board. The Board is 
also empowered to employ a paid secretary, 
whose compensation is fixed by its directors.

THE 


Housing Problems in Minneapolis 

MINNEAPOLIS, MInn.—More evidence of 
the increasing interest of business men’s 
organizations in civic matters is furnished 
in a recent report of the Minneapolis Civic 
and Commerce Association on housing con- 
ditions in this city. 

After referring to notably favorable as- 
pects of the housing problem in Minneap- 
olis, President Fiske, in a pre face to the 
report, calls attention to the fact that 
“conditions have begun to appear in Minne- 
apolis which seriously threaten the home life 
of thousands whose welfare and happiness are 
absolutely essential to the future progress of 
our city, viewed from the industrial, moral 
and every other standpoint. * * * It is 
vastly more important to every business man 
that Minneapolis be prepared to comfortably 
house and care for a population of 1,000,000 
twenty-five years hence than that the indus- 
tries to support such a population be secured. 
If we can make our city a place where labor is 
contented and happy, then the efficiency of 
labor will be so greatly increased that indus- 
tries are bound to come and will be glad to 
remain. 

The report has been prepared, both from 
a textual and topographical standpoint, for 
the purpose of letting the people of Min- 
neapolis know whether the subject of better 
housing should receive the consideration of 
those interested in the present and future 
welfare of that city, and as such it admir 
ably serves its purpose. 

The report indicates that in spite of there 
being no well-defined slum area in Minne 
apolis, nevertheless every possible element 
is present in scattered instances which, 
brought together, make the worst kind of 
slums. Instances of excessive lot occupa 
tion, of the occupation of damp, unsanitary 
basements, of dark rooms, of inadequate 
toilet facilities, of the absence of a water 
supply and provision for slop disposal are 
plainly shown. The chapter on dangerous 
tendencies emphasizes the tendency towards 
room overcrowding, towards apartment 
house life, towards houses in our back 
yards, and the lack of attention to city 
planning. 

Citizens of Minneapolis have been proud 
to think of their city as a city without slums, 
and to an unusual degree this is true. Their 
attitude upon discovery of the facts re- 
vealed as a result of the housing investi- 
gation is significant. No attempt was made 
to cover up the real facts. Every news- 
paper in the city printed extensive articles

based upon the report, with many photo- 
graphs, showing examples of bad condi- 
tions, and were a unit in demanding that 
steps be taken to prevent any further in 
crease of such conditions. 

The Minneapolis Civic and Commerce 
Association has a strong Housing Commit- 
tee, which has grappled with the problem 
through its Sub-Committees on Housing 
Code, on Town Planning, and on Working 
men’s Homes. A carefully drafted housing 
code was submitted to the Legislature with 
the approval not only of the 
Commerce 


Civic and 
\ssociation, which has a mem 
bership of three thousand business and pro- 
fessional men, but with the approval also 
of the Real Estate Board, the Builders’ Ex- 
change, the Master Builders’ Association, 
the Minnesota Chapter of Architects, the 
Central and Labor Assembly and 
the Socialist Party. Even the City Coun 
cil adopted a resolution favorable to the 
passage of such a code.

nately, failed of ‘action in the

legislature. Its high civic consciousness 
is admirably summed up in the following 
final paragraph of the report: 

‘A new spirit is developing in industry, a 
spirit born of the realization that all industry 
suffers through the misfortune of any factor. 
The employer fails to prosper as his men fail 
to prosper. Bad housing for the workmen 
means bad business for the one who hires. In 
the light of this spirit, the primary question is 
not ‘What can the tenant afford?’ it is “What 
can Minneapolis afford?’ If we are to develop 
in Minneapolis the highest type of civilization, 
if industry is to thrive permanently, if art and 
music are to serve their highest purposes, we 
must first recognize as an essential prerequisite 
to the realization of these high ideals the pro 
viding of a home life for every family, rich 
or poor, that shall insure to them their in- 
alienable rights to sanitation, safety, ventila 
tion, privacy, sunlight, space and beauty.”

Planning for Extensive Harbor 
and Rail Terminals 

ProvipENCcE, R. I.—The future develop 
ment and prosperity of Rhode Island art 
believed by the Providence Chamber o 
Commerce to hinge upon the enlargemen 
of Rhode Island’s water and rail transpor 
tation facilities. For the purpose of cor 
passing those objects, the Metropolitan Te1 
minal Development Commission of Provi 
dence has been organized, of which th 
chairman, vice-chairman and secretary is 
each an officer and director of the Provi 
dence Chamber of Commerce, the chairma 
and secretary of the Commission being r« 
spectively the president and secretary o 
the Chamber of Commerce. The directo1 
ate of the Commission is made up of repré 
sentatives of each of the following inter 
ests, whose hearty codperation has been s« 
cured: 


Office of the United States Engineer at New; 

The State Harbor Improvement Commissior 

The State Harbor Commission 

The Seekonk River Commission 

The State Public Utilities Commissiv 

The Metropolitan Park Commission 

City of Providence 

City of Pawtucket

Southern New England Railway ( pat 

Merchants & Miners Transportation ( 

Colonial Line 

New England Navigation Co. 

The Fabre Line 

Say State Line 

Providence Chamber of Commerce 

The Commission is directly concerned in 
the development of Providence Harbor, th 
Providence and Pawtucket Rivers, and all 
the harbor and rail terminals of the Provi 
dence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, Fast 
Providence, Cranston community. An ef 
fort will be made to unite the interests in 
the towns mentioned in a strong cohesiv« 
movement for the development of their re- 
spective terminals which will result bene 
ficially to the whole community. 

One of the features in the plan is to con- 
struct a tunnel under the harbor, through 
which the majority of the trains would he 
run instead of through the city. This would 
permit the removal of the most of th 
switching tracks from the center of the 
community mentioned, and so far as Provi- 
dence in particular is concerned, would 


greatly improve the appearance of the 


419 


neighborhood surrounding the beautiful 
white marble State 


apitol lhe tunnel 
would cost between $5,000,000 and $6,000,- 
000. However, since Providence already 
has two tunnels under its most attractive 
residential section, the undertaking is not 
thought to be impossible oO

City Planning Legislation 


Maptson, N. ] tfective work by com 
inercial organizations resulted in the enact- 
ment of a new law by the New Jersey Leg- 
islature last month. There has been on the 


ute books of New Jersey Since I9i3 a 

giving to the first and second class 
cities the power to appoint municipal plan- 
ning and art commissions. Such power had, 
however, not been accorded to the smaller 
cities and boroughs. 

Realizing the need for such legislation 
for their own community, the directors of 
the Board of Public Improvement of Madi 
son, N. J., suggested to the New Jersey 
State Chamber of Commerce the desirabil- 
ity of cooperating in the advocacy of a law 
of this kind. As a result, the State Cham 
ber of Commerce appointed a committe 
which drafted what was subsequently known 
as Assembly Bill No. 591. When this bill 
was printed by the legislature, it was ac- 
companied by the following statement: 

In recognition of the need so frequently 
rent of more careful advance planning of 
municipal improvements, such as streets 
public buildings, etc., and of the loca 








tion and design of public buildings and publi 
works of art, the New Jersey State Chamber 
of Commerce heartily endorses the foregoing 
bill and bespeaks for it the favorable action of 
the Legislature at the present session. 


“This bill gives all municipalities, except 
first and second class cities (for which similar 
provision has heen made by Laws of 10983, 
Chapters 72 and 170), the power to appoint 
municipal plan and art commissions, the mem- 
bers of which are to serve without pay. Such 
commissions are to act in an advisory ca 
pacity to the local municipal governments and 
are to have no power to incur indebtedness, 
except such as shall have been provided for 
and covered by appropriations previously made 
by the local municipal governments.” 

The new law was signed by Governor 
Fielder April 6. It is believed that it will 
he of material aid to the many small and 
growing municipalities in New Jersey in 
controlling more effectively than heretofore 
their future growth and development along 
rational lines.

Departmental Reporting for Cities and Counties 


Third Instalment: The Use of Reports as a Basis for Judgment and Administrative Action 


By Herbert R. Sands 


Of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research 


The Administrative Need 
ANY city and county officials fail in 
M their ambition to achieve success 
in public office because they neglect 
to equip themselves with the necessary facil 
ities for administration. As charts and 
other nautical equipment must be used to 
guide a ship on its true course in order that 
it may avoid the many dangers of the sea 
and be brought into port promptly and 
safely, so must the ship of state of every 
city and county government, in order to 
avoid waste, losses, and all the results of 
general inefficiency, be guided by the use of 
charts and other special equipment devised 
for that particular purpose. 

In a small organization it is frequently 
possible for the chief executive personally 
to inspect the work operations and physical 
condition of plant, material, etc., and even 
to summarize them mentally as a basis for 
judgment in issuing future directions. In 
large organizations, however, such inspec- 
tion and impressions are impossible because 
of the added demands on the time of the 
chief executive, which do not obtain in 
smaller organizations. In small organiza- 
tions it often happens that subordinates 
render verbally their reports of current 
operations and results. Since the latter are 
comparatively small in volume, verbal re- 
ports suffice as a basis for executive judg- 
ment. However, in large organizations such 
reporting methods are unsatisfactory, be- 
cause being so varied in character the facts 
reported are difficult of summarization. 
They do not leave in the mind of the exe- 
cutive as clear a mental picture of the mat- 
ter reported as do written reports. 

It sometimes happens that the subordi- 
nates in a department conspire to keep in- 
formation away from their chief executive, 
in the belief that once the latter is informed 
of existing conditions and methods he will 
take steps to make changes therein. The 


[422] 


writer once heard the chief of police of one 
of the largest cities in this country complain 
because he did not know what was going on 
around him in his own department. He sat, 
as it were, above and apart from the large 
force of men of whom he was the titular 
head, having ample power, being held re- 
sponsible by the city for results, but not 
having adopted measures to provide him- 
self with the kind of information essential 
to achieving the results desired. The duties 
he had laid down for himself kept him very 
busy, and yet because of the fact that he 
was provided with no adequate means for 
supervision, his energies were, to a large 
extent, spent daily in what might be called 
waste motion. He gravitated at a high 
momentum, but without any axis. Had an 
adequate system existed for keeping him in- 
formed with respect to the real conditions 
in his own department, one-half of the time 
and energy expended would have sufficed to 
secure far more satisfactory results. 

\ well-worn maxim of successful admin- 
istrators is “Organize, Deputize, and Supe. 
vise.” This direction has been used by more 
administrative officials of private than of 
public corporations. The general manager 
of a great American railroad has placed in 
his hands each day summarized informing 
reports which enable him to review the 
operations of the vast equipment, trackage 
and general plant for which he is held re- 
sponsible. He is thus enabled to feel con- 
stantly, as it were, the pulse beats of the en- 
tire system, and thereby to advise and direct 
operations understandingly. Similarly, the 
manager of a great telephone or telegraph 
company needs only to glance at reports 
placed in his hands daily to know all the 
important facts relative to the operations of 
the company’s entire system the previous 
day. The despatch with which a day’s 
work—from that of the humblest employe 
to the most important—is summarized and 











THE AMERICAN CITY 


expedited to the manager’s office in some 
terminal city, should be to public_ officials 
a striking object lesson in efficient adminis- 
tration. The words “Organize, Deputize 
and Supervise” should be framed and hung 
in the office of every mayor and department 
head of every city and county in the United 
States. A principal reason that commission 
government has failed in many cities to 
achieve the ends hoped for by its advocates 
is that the commission charters have failed 
to provide for accounting and reporting 
systems, which by bringing proper informa 
tion currently and automatically to the no- 
tice of the commissioners would insure wise 
and successful supervision. 

No executive in charge of road, street or 
sewer work can properly direct the work 
which is to be performed on the morrow un- 
less he knows what was done yesterday, 
what was left undone, and what is being 
done to-day. Similarly with respect to pub- 
lic executives in any other city or county de- 
partment—-whether it be the head of a 
police force or the head of a charitable in- 
stitution—the results secured to date, the 
existing conditions and needs, should be the 
background for his judgment and for direc- 
tion of future action. 

Although it is trite to state that there can 
be no successful supervision unless it be the 
expression of sound judgment, the fact 
should, nevertheless, be emphasized that the 
average public official has not sensed his 
problem enough to realize that such judg 
ment is impossible unless it be based on 
proper information, and that this, in turn, 
must meet the tests of completeness, correct 
ness, and promptness. 

Everyone can appreciate how the 
erals on 


gen- 
European battlefields must, per- 
force, have complete, accurate, and prompt 
information relative to the activities of their 
forces as a basis for directing the further 
energies thereof. Although the need of the 
city and county administrator for informa- 
tion which is just as complete, accurate, 
and prompt, is less vital, it is no less existent 
and has just as direct a bearing on subse- 
quent results. 


Supplying the Need 
To supply the administrative need for in- 
formation above cited is not so difficult as 
one might suppose from the fact that of the 
multitude of public officials in this country 


423 


so few have taken steps toward that end. 
Only three processes are necessary 

First, the executive, either himself alone, 
or with the aid of an efficiency engineer o1 
specialist in administration shall, after a 
thorough analysis of the problem, determine 
just what information he needs 

Second, he shall, either himself alone, 
with special assistance, devise or adopt a 
books and docu 
ments the data determined upon as bein 


t 
desired. The foundation structure of such 


system of recording in 


a system must naturally comprise records 


and documents for recording data in con 
siderable detail so as to facilitate correla 
tion and summarization, and also that it 
may be preserved for purposes of reference 


s the spokes of a wagon wheel must con 


nect the points of contact 
hub 


the tire to the 
the central connection with the mot 
power, so it is essential that reporting docu 
ments shall be designed or adopted by means 
of which the information recorded at th 
points of contact—street or road gangs, 
quarries, asphalt plants, subordinate offices, 
etc., may be summarized and converged at 
the hub—the central executive office. 
Third, he shall see to it that the system 
of recording and reporting thus devised or 
adopted is thoroughly installed. It is at this 
point that such systems frequently break 
down. There are in many offices, private as 
well as public, one or more employes who 
by reason of long association with old 
methods and procedures exert an inimical 
influence against the thorough installation 
of any system which is different. There 
fore, if success is to crown the thought and 
labor expended on the new plan, it is ne- 
cessary that the executive shall personally 
with a firm hand remove 
influences and conditions 


all such untoward 
before the installa- 
tion begins. 

Having gotten the new recording and re 
porting forms into satisfactory operation, all 
that remains is for the executive to exercis 
the same degree of supervision necessary to 
the proper operation of any system, method, 
or procedure. 

Lest the gather an impression 
from the frequent mention herein of the 


reader 


word system that something is meant which 
is intricate or complicated, and hence diffi- 
cult and expensive to operate, the writer 
would emphasize before proceeding to a 
further discussion of the plan, that simplicity 











EE er ee 





—- 





Ss 





424 THE AMERICAN CITY 


should be the keynote actuating the entire 
undertaking. It must be obvious that in a 
large department having many and varied 
functions and activities, more data should 
be recorded and reported than in a small de- 
partment with few functions and activities. 
Even in the former, however, there can be 
no justification for installing a complicated 
system, for it will act more as an irritation 
than an aid. 

Reference to the needed system as one of 
“recording and reporting” instead of as an 
system is intentional. One 
usually thinks of an accounting system as 


“accounting” 


relating mostly to financial statistics, where- 
as what is here urged is the recording and 
reporting of certain conditions and of statis- 
tics on designated features of operations, 
irrespective of whether such matter has any 
financial aspects or not. There are many 
functions of government—such as health 
administration, police administration, ete.— 
wherein the factors which constitute tests 
of operating efficiency are not financial in 
any respect; and although it is entirely 
correct to provide for the recording and re- 
porting thereof within the circle and scope 
of an accounting system, it is to be under- 
stood that the latter term is then used in 
a broader sense than is customarily rec 
ognized in general accountancy practice. 


The Content of Reports 

The content of the administrative reports 
needed by city and county officials will vary 
according to the functions and activities of 
each department. The space limitation of 
these articles prevents the insertion herein 
of the content outline of report forms for 
the various departments. We can only em 
phasize by way of guidance that only such 
factors should be recorded and reported 
which, when viewed by the administrator, 
will actually serve him as efficiency tests 
and promote wise supervision by enabling 
him to reach correct conclusions. In this 
connection it is to be remembered that many 
activities have little or no administrative 
value as matters of record. Activities of 
this character are, in fact, usually sub- 
activities, and although important as inte- 
grals of a whole work operation, yet if de- 
scribed in a report would have no admin- 
istrative value. 

Comparisons have been discussed previ- 
ously in these articles in connection with 
their use in reports to the public. Their 


use in reports for current administrative use 
is no less important. Reports for the latter 
purpose have but a limited value unless facts 
and figures of previous periods are inserted 
which will afford comparisons of results. 
lor further comparative purposes it is also 
frequently desirable to insert in an admin- 
istrative report, in a column or line paral- 
leling the most recent figures, those amounts, 
quantities or costs which have been pre- 
viously determined upon as standards. We 
unhesitatingly pass judgment on much of 
human action, and even on the manifesta~ 
tions of nature, by applying our sense of re- 
lative proportions—whether it be the de- 
gree of excellence of a painting, the speed 
of an engine, or the matutinal verdure of 
a field. However, good administration de- 
mands that when conclusions of proportion 
(degree of efficiency) are to control or 
direct administrative action, as in the case 
of a city or county executive, a correct 
hasis of comparison shall be afforded. 
Hence it is that the determination of ser- 
vice standards and the use thereof in con- 
nection with administrative reports is 
urged. 

Of no less value also in administrative 
than in public reports is the use of per- 
centages and averages, and the same rules 
governing their use in the latter apply with 
equal force to the former. 


Frequency of Reports 

The frequency which is desirable in ad- 
ministrative reports for cities and counties 
will necessarily vary according to the char- 
acter of the department or office concern- 
ing the operation of which reports are de- 
sired. Generally speaking, it may be said 
that there is greater need for daily reports 
in cities than in counties, and in larger 
cities than in smaller ones, it being rec- 
ognized, of course, that there are a few 
counties in the United States wherein the 
amount of county business transacted daily 
is so great as to render daily reports desir- 
able. Naturally, the greater frequency with 
which reports are rendered, the more com- 
plete will be the administrative control 
which it will be possible for the executive 
head to exercise. 

An advantage which should not be lost 
sight of when considering the adoption of a 
system of administrative reporting is the ex- 
cellent moral effect which it has upon the 
personnel of a department. Experience 











THE AMERICAN CITY 42 


has demonstrated that the very fact of be- 
ing required to render a daily account of 
work done and of conditions at the end of 
the day serves as a stimulus on each person 
so reporting. When results or lack of re- 
sults must be written down in black and 
white, it is only human that an employe 
prefers to have the statement reflect facts 
to his credit rather than to his discredit.

Having determined upon the content of 
each report, it is important that the mat- 
ter be arranged on report forms which are 
of standard design and size. For example, 
if the daily reports rendered by inspectors 
in the field are all of a standard size, they 
not only will fit small standard loose-leaf 
binders which the inspectors may carry in 
their pockets during the day, but the re- 
ports when extracted therefrom and _ for- 
warded to the central office will also fit in 
standard size filing cabinets, post binders, 
or other standardized receptacles. When 
such reports are summarized, it is equally 
important that the summaries should be 
made on forms of standard size and style, 
so that although they emanate from sundry 
departments and offices located in different 
parts of the city or county, they may, 
nevertheless, be placed together in the same 
binder on the desk of the chief executive 
head. Even after the latter has finished 
with the current reports, a standard size 
thereof facilitates their being filed for fu- 
ture reference. An excellent plan is for 
such executive to have a flexible covered 
loose-leaf binder on his desk tabbed accord- 
ing to departments. As the summary re- 
ports of each day are received by his sec- 
retary or stenographer, the latter will place 
them in the binder behind the proper thumb 
tabs. They will be allowed to accumulate 
therein until the end of the month, when 
they will be removed, assorted by depart- 
ments and filed in transfer binders or cases 
—there being a separate one for each de- 
partment. A summarization of the daily re- 
ports of each department for the entire 
month will have been prepared by this time 
and inserted behind the respective tabs in

WATER TOWER IN VOLUNTEER PARK, SEATTLE 


A Water Tower Observatory 


By M. Pelton White 


HI sightlic st place in Seattle is the 
observatory at the top of the 60-foot 
water tower located in’ Volunteer 
Park. Its sixteen windows afford a glor 
ious and unrivaled panorama of the city 
and environs. The Sound, Salmon Bay, 
Lake Union, Lake Washington and the 
snow-covered peaks of the Cascade and 
Olympic ranges enchant the beholder. 
Recently the Mountaineers have had 
markers placed in several of the windows 
so that sightseers are now able to locate 
the various points of interesi. The mark 
ers are metal discs, semi-circular in shape, 


[426] 


mounted on slightly larger wooden plates 
that are fastened in a horizontal position to 
the window guards. The metal plate is 
studded with screw calks. Sighting from 
the pivot point to those on the circumfer- 
ence locates the different peaks. Elevation, 
name and distance from Seattle are also 
given. 

Iwo enclosed spiral stairways, not an un- 
duly fatiguing climb, lead to the observa- 
tory. The tower itself, built of vitrified 
brick, rises from flower-terraced banks and 
is surrounded by the 48-acre park with its 
tree-shaded drives, shrub-lined walks,

The Hazardous and Unsanitary 
Wooden Fence 

rhere is war upon the wooden, tight- 
boarded alley fence. A recent article in the 
Quarterly of the National Fire Protection 
\ssociation emphasizes the dangers of “this 
time-dishonored fire-breeder,” giving views 
of opposite sides of an alley in Baltimore 
on one side the board fences still remain, 
unsightly, unsanitary and unsafe; on the 
other side the wire fencing is no barrier to 
fresh air and sunlight, and there are bits 
of lawn, free from rubbish, where children 
can play in safety. 

The wooden fence probably came into 
use when lumber was cheap and privacy 
seemed attainable by this sort of screen. 
But with the building of rows of two- and 
three-story dwellings, privacy is invaded by 
the eye of the neighbor in the upper story 
and is no longer a valid excuse for the 
evils promoted by the wooden fence. The 
abolition of these barriers places upon the 
city the obligation to collect and dispose of 
ashes and garbage and fire-breeding rub- 
bish. Fire starting in one yard may easily 
he carried through the whole block by the 
board fences, which also hinder police in- 
spection and afford protection to sneak 
thieves. 

Firemen look upon high board fences 
with wholesome disgust. Chief Tremblay, 
of the Montreal Fire Department, has ex- 
pressed himself strongly on this subject, as 
follows: 

From the standpoint of public safety, I con- 
sider that the substitution of wire fences for 
the present wooden fences would be a marked 
improvement. Wooden fences around yards, 
etc., invite the accumulation of rubbish of 
every description, which is a constant source 
of fire and danger to health. 

Our annual statistics show a great number of 
fires in yards and fences that I am sure would 
be curtailed, or even entirely eliminated, if 
wire fences were used. Wire fences would 
make it easier for our inspectors to detect the 
dangerous conditions of yards, etc., and would 
therefore enable them to enforce civic by-laws 
respecting fire prevention and health regula- 
tion with greater facility. 

In general appearance it would be a vast 
improvement also, as surroundings would be 
more uniform, and yards could thus be trans-

formed into attractive playgrounds for chil- 
dren. 

Fire Marshal George W. Elliott, of Phila- 
delphia, is of the same opinion, as shown 
in a letter of his about this matter: 

I strongly believe in the entire elimination 
of high board fences. 

They are dangerous to any community in 
that they allow accumulation of rubbish—and 
rubbish is a prolific cause of fire. 

In alleys and similar places they have been 
used to hide many crimes, so that considerable 
benefit would be obtained by the low form of 
iron or wire fence. 

These are points of consideration for 
Safety First reformers. They indicate the 
need of aiding the cause of fire prevention 
by passing city by-laws compelling the tear- 
ing down of these board barriers and the 
erection of sanitary fencing in their place.

The city offices and the fire department 
headquarters are both provided for in South 
Pasadena’s new City Hall and fire engine 
house. The building stands on the corner 
of Mound Avenue and Mission Street, in 
the center of the business district, and is 
constructed of white brick and concrete; 
it is commodious in proportions and elegant 
in finish. 

Entering the building from Mission

the City Engineer and the Superintendent 
of Streets. On the Mound Avenue side 
one enters a corridor leading to the offices 
of the building inspector, the City Marshal, 
the telephone operator, and to the city jail. 
From this corridor a broad stairway winds 
to the second floor, where there is a large 
council chamber, also the office of the City 
Health Officer and the living apartments of 
the Fire Marshal and his family. The inte-

The Prevention of Dust on Macadam Roads* 


By Major W. 


W. Crosby 


Cousulting Engineer, Baltimore, Md. 


P to ten years ago the subject of dust 
prevention on roads had received 
comparatively little attention, except 

in a few specific instances and in connection 
with city street maintenance. A few fruit 
growers had complained—especially where 
located along str« tches of shell or soft lime- 
stone roadways—of the damage done by 
clouds of dust spread from the roads in dry 
weather spells by strong winds over their 
growing trees and vines; but in the main a 
considerable amcunt of dust from even im 
proved roads seemed to be regarded as an 
inevitable accompaniment of the service 
able roadway. 

“Along came,” not “Ruth,” but the auto- 
mobile (or perhaps Ruth was in the auto- 
mobile). Immediately the dust 
was vastly increased in importance and 
brought to general attention. The abuttor 
began to receive the support and sympathy 
he deserved from the neighbors and from 
the visitors to the locality, from the tray- 
elers through it, and even from the auto- 


question

and International Good Roads Convention at Toront

mobilists themselves, the driving of whose 
cars was interfered with by the clouds of 
dust raised over the roadway. 

In fact, the wide penetration or distribu 
tion of the 
ness reminds one of the 


effects of the increased dusti 


story of the colore 


men’s discussion on the artillery now in use 


abroad. Strickland Gillilan tells it thus

such, for instance, as greater public interest 
in and demand for better hygienic condi 
tions on the roads as well as elsewhere, and 
the important matter of protecting the road 
ways themselves from the removal from 
their surfaces of fine- material valuable for 
protecting in many cases the road-crust 
itself from deterioration. 

It has never been suggested, apparently, 
that the remedy for the unhealthtul and un- 
satisfactory dustiness of the highways is 
the abolition of the motor vehicle. On the 
contrary, their increase in numbers and 
their development for all sorts of purposes 
seem to be inevitable and probably fortu

the curing of the de fects of the roadway.

best method, as conditions are “never—well, 
hardly ever,’ twice alike. 

General agreement among highway au- 
thorities has cd veloped the fact that dust 
proceeds not only from attrition of the 
roadway surface by hard tires and the feet 
of animals, but also comes from the grinding 
on each other of the piece S ol aggregate or 
road-metal forming the pavement or crust 
Chis internal wear of the surfacing is much 
greater than was formerly suspected, and 
it largely accounts in many cases for the 
layer of mud and dust to be found on mac- 
adam, for instance, even when freely re- 


moved from the surface at frequent inter- 
vals by scraping or SW eeping. 

he amount of the internally produced 
mud seems to bear a relation to the weight 
of the traffic, and to the moisture present— 
such as results from sprinkling with water 

as well as to the friability of the stone 
used and to the methods of construction. 

Heavy vehicles, even when shod with rub- 
ber tires, set up severe strains in the road 
crust and tend to make the particles of 
stone in macadam rub against each other in 
resisting these strains. If water is present 
n excess in the mass at the same time, the 
stones wear into mud more easily. Soft 
naterials, of course, produce more fine ma- 
terial than harder ones under the same con- 
ditions. If the particles of material com- 
posing the macadam are closely knit and 
mechanically or physically bound together 
by their angular shapes, they naturally move 
less under the strains, and the rubbing and 
consequent fine material produced is less in 
amount. 

Real dust prev ention, it will be seen, be 
gins with the construction of the road crust. 
In this work it will be necessary to avoid, 
as far as practicable, the subsequent pro- 
duction of both superficial and internal dust 
—which latter rises eventually to the sur- 
face and becomes appreciable externally— 
by selecting road metal of the appropriate

hardness considering the traffic, by provid- 
ing through proper drainage against the 
continued presence of an excess of water 
in the road-crust, and by securing the firm 
est angular bond that the metal is capable 
of in the macadam. 

It has been found that even where good 
road metal was used, and under light traffic, 
road-crusts built with the use of an excess 
of fine material in their first construction 
have proved to be subsequently more dusty 
under the same conditions than where the 
fine material used was kept to a minimum. 
Evidently the excess of fine material, not 
only from its presence easily furnished more 
dust to be raised, but also it prevented the 
closest interlocking of the coarser particles. 
This resulted in an increased movement of 
them under strains on the surface and there 
fore the production of more internal dust. 
The dustiest kind of a stoned roadway is 
an old turnpike where the stones were liber- 
ally mixed with earth in order to help their 
compaction under traffic, and where they 
are bedded, like plums in a pudding, in a 
matrix of fine material.

Municipal Ownership in Berlin 

The Overseas News Agency on April 10 
gave out the following: 

“In the midst of the world conflagration the 
Berlin municipal administration is undertak- 
ing the gigantic enterprise of buying and con- 
ducting the Berlin electrical works. The mu- 
nicipal council has unanimously appropriated 
130,000,000 marks ($32,500,000) for the pur- 
pose of obtaining the street car system and 
assuring cheap electricity for the citizens. 

“At the same time the suburb of Schoenberg 
is expending a large sum for an extension of 
its underground lines, and Berlin is building 
a new line connecting the northern and south- 
ern parts of the city.”

The Changing Attitude of American 
Cities Towards the Utility Problem 


In lectures delivered recently before sev- 
eral eastern universities, Morris L. Cooke, 
Director of the Department of Public Works 
of Philadelphia, has given a striking review 
of the difficulties confronting American 
cities in seeking economy in their public 
utilities—electric, gas, water, telephones 
and street railways. Although he considers 
the utility problem, owing to its bearing on 
crooked politics and bad government, as 
virtually the crux of the municipal situa- 
tion, Mr. Cooke deprecates general muni- 
cipal ownership of these utilities at this 
time, simply because our cities have prob 
lems enough on their hands now without 
these added burdens. He advocates rather 
such regulation of the business of these 
companies as will give the public a reason- 
able return in service for the rates charged.

Two of Mr. Cooke’s lectures have just 
been issued in the form of a pamphlet en- 
titled “Snapping Cords,” the cost of print- 
ing which has been met by friends of good 
municipal government. The author’s con- 
clusions are thus summarized on the front 
cover of the pamphlet: 


“The unity of policy and action among pri- 
vate interests in the utility field—gas, water, 
electric and others—is almost complete. This 
solidarity is practically world-wide in scope 
and is of a type not reached by existing laws. 

“A small group of financiers and promoters 
—and their banking agents—provide for the 
public almost ready made, not only securities, 
but public opinion, laws, machinery and even 
the technical experts. 

“Publicity—incessant and relentless—is the 
only remedy. This must provide open and 
fair bookkeeping, with inventories made on a 
basis comparable with those used in private 
business and a uniform system of cost account- 
ing, tying in with the general books and in- 
cluding the smallest details of the enterprise. 

“Inter-city and nation-wide codperation, 
through the Utilities Bureau, must provide for 
each individual city the support which each 
private company receives from the league of 
private interests.”

Grade Crossing Elimination 

The Engineering Record im its issue of 
March 13, publishes a valuable article by 
Associate Editor C. W. Stark on “Grade 
Law and Its Effect on Grade 
Crossing Elimination.” The chief purpose 
of the article “is to emphasize what cin 
hardly be disputed, that fairness demands 
the participation by municipality, state or 
both, in the expense of grade-crossing elimi- 
nation; and to show that a systematic and 
continuous program, with the object always 
in view of solving each individual problem 
in the best way, can best be carried out by 
a fixed proportionate division of all of the 
expense.” 

The writer's conclusions are summarized 
by him as follows:

and the

stereop- 


Crossing 


1. That the absence of any grade-crossing 
law means increasing chaos as grade crossings 
become more and more dangerous. 

That the situation is only slightly miti- 
wee by leaving to the public service commis- 
sion to decide in each case as to the distribution 
of hg expense of elimination work. 

That to compel the railroad to bear the 
aie burden is indefensible. 

4. That a flexible percentage basis depending 
on which party raises the issue is fatal to the 
nec essary coc yperation. 

. That only a fixed percentage division of

Civ” 


the entire expense will lead to the best 
ane of all grade-crossing problems. 

That the New York percentages as ap- 
olied to existing crossings—so for the railroad, 
25 for the municipality and 25 for the state- 
are equitable and conducive to a vigorous pro- 
gram of grade separation. 

That a number of points are involved in 
the question of participation in the expense by 
street railways affected by grade separations 
and should be given careful consideration 

. That a plan should be devised for using 
a state’s funds approximately as fast as they 
are available, so that legislators will not be 
misled by the balance, already assigned to 
definite improvements. 

That railroads should not be required to 
pay more than 25 per cent of the cost of open 
ing new streets over or under the tracks. 

10. That municipalities should pay a small 
percentage (not to exceed 20 per cent) of the 
first and annual protecting existing 
grade crossings.

SANITATION 


We show illustrations of our Canco Trash Burner and Canco Fly 
Trap, two articles to help in the “clean up” campaigns which are 
spreading over the country. 


“CANCO” RUBBISH AND 
TRASH BURNER 


This is practically the only burner on the market that will withstand 


heat without warping, the body being made 
from ONE PIECE OPEN HEARTH SHEET STEEL. 


Owing to its peculiar construction it is 
practically indestructible. All joints of the 
burner are welded; no rivets to become loose. 





Canco Burner is the only burner which has 
a solid bottom, detachable base or pan. With 
ordinary burners the ashes are generally scat- 
tered around 
wherever the 
rubbish is burnt, 
making an un- 
sightly appear- 
ance. 


“CANCO” FLY TRAPS 


There are some that look like Canco 
but they are about as similar as a 
“flivver”’ car is to a high speed racing 
car. First of all, the Canco is an all 
metal trap. No wood pieces to warp 
or rip off. It must wear and it'll catch 
more flies than Mr. Carter has pills. 
Joints are all electrically welded. It is 
made on strictly mechanical lines and 
after a careful study of other makes and 
their operation.

Paving Pitch in the joints

It still clings to the blocks in

Chemically the pitch in these

In none of these old pavements

every joint is an expansion joint. 
The pavements are much quieter 
than if the joints were filled with 
cement and the footing for horses 
is better because a shallow groove 
is left at the top of each joint.

Legal Principles of Public Health Ad-

$7.50 
The extensive progress in sanitary science made 
during recent years has opened up a field in which 
lawyers and judges have need of becoming specially 
informed. Health officers, for their part, would fre 
quently profit by a greater knowledge of the legal 
facts affecting health matters. This volume, the au 
thor of which presents the unusual combination of a 
medical practitioner versed in the law, aims to offer a 
common ground of understanding to both these classes 
and thus make possible the fullest codperation between 
them. In Part One, general principles of law in their 
relation to public health are discussed. Part Two takes 
up the specific questions of quarantine and allied sub- 
jects; licenses; water-supply, drainage, garbage; pure 
food and drug regulation; industrial regulation; school 
inspection; and eugenics. The volume does not limit 
itself to a statement of the law as found, but abounds 
in suggestions which it is hoped may aid in perfect 
ing proposed statutes

HONOLULU 


When the city of Honolulu, T. H., decided to 
register Motor Vehicles, this thriving community 
searched the world for the “best’’ possible product 
at the “best”’ price. 


Naturally, attention was directed to Baltimore, the 
home of ‘‘BALTO”’ Porcelain Enameled Iron 
Signs. In this particular instance TIME was at a 
premium—Honolulu talked with us via WIRELESS— 
in “72 hours” this contract was closed and part of 
Honolulu’s order for Automobile and Motorcycle 


License Tags was ACTUALLY IN WORK —\that’s 
service. 

Service alone did not guarantee this contract— 
quality, finish and dependability were the virtues 
which first suggested themselves to the officials of this 
far away city, and these virtues alone have given our 
product the world-wide distribution it now enjoys. For 
quality and service in the development of the most 
modern and artistic municipal signs, we lead.

Get 100% Efficiency 
in Your Playground 


Bath Houses 


Is your Playground Bath House equipped 
with the old style hot and cold water valves for 
regulating the showers? Do the bathers waste 
time and heat in adjusting temperature of water? 

Every playground Bath House has to meet 
the demands of capacity crowds—especially 
where athletic events are popular. The econom- 
ical way to increase the capacity and get 100% 
efficiency is to install 


Ingham 
Shower Mixers 


This mixer gives the bather instant control 
of water temperature. This assures safety to 
bather. Temperature remains fixed until water 
is turned off and scalding ts tmposstble. 

The mixing is done thoroughly in the cham- 
ber. There is no waste of water, steam or fuel. 
Bather uses the minimum amount of time, thus 
greatly increasing capacity of bath house. 

The Ingham Shower Mixer is made in styles 
to suit individual and multiple showers. En- 
tirely automatic and ‘Foolproof.’’ Noiseless 
and self-cleaning. Costs less to maintain and 
operate than any other mixer.

The Dustoline for Roads Company, of Sum-

city engineer of East Orange, N. J., an in- 
teresting tabulation of the results of an entire

makes of non-asphaltic oils. To each of the 
companies were assigned stretches of macadam

A visitor to New York the other day re- 
marked upon the cleanly appearance of the 
“white wings,” or, in other words, the em 
ployes of the Street and Sewer Department. 
\s is well known, they have always worn white 
washable outer garments, with the exception 
of their hats. They are now using hats made 
of Fabrikoid artificial leather, which is wash 
able, and when coat and trousers are being 
cleaned the cap is also brightened. 

This change will no doubt save money, as 
hats quickly become dirty and, unless cleanable, 
would soon have to be replaced.

Flushing and Sprinkling Streets 


A new machine for street sprinkling and 
flushing has recently been brought out by the 
Tiffin Wagon Company, of Tiffin, Ohio. It 
consists of a Tiffin motor truck of 3% tons 
capacity and conventional design, upon which 
is mounted a 900-gallon tank with devices that 
allow power pressure flushing and sprinkling 
or gravity sprinkling. 

The pump for pressure is of centrifugal type, 
giving up to 60 pounds pressure, and is in no 


wise connected with the vehicle-propelling 
mechanism, thus allowing the operator to 
change the vehicle speed at will without affect 
ing the water pressure. The two flushing noz- 
zles are provided with universal ball and socket 
joints, enabling the operator to throw two 
streams on one side of the street or at any 
angle desired. The nozzles being well to the 
front, their work is always observed. This 
machine is said to have a range to cover the 
widest streets found anywhere. While it would 
ordinarily be most convenient to fill the ma-

High Tire Mileage 


NT ponnetnecesntieanbeus <euncevncesnes e 








Yet End Destructive Vibration 


Get to the fire safely. That’s what you 
demand of fire trucks. 

Ordinary solid rubber tires do more 
damage to the apparatus than the tires 
themselves are worth. This has greatly 
reduced the safe speed of some fire 
trucks. 

But Goodyear makes a dual Cushion 
tire that is built for high speed and great 
resiliency. Patented features reduce 
vibration to a minimum. This saves 
the apparatus from tremendous shocks, 
yet gives a high tire mileage. 

The All-Weather tread is the ideal 
pneumatic tire for use on Chiefs’ cars or 
light apparatus demanding high speeds. 
Has all the famous Goodyear features 
that combat rim-cutting, skidding, tread 
separation and b'owouts.

No Dust Nuisance 
on this Road 


This photograph demonstrates 
what has been done in many pro- 
gressive communities to keep the 
highways in perfect condition. 

The surface of this road is 
smooth and firm, free of ruts, and 
neither loaded wagons nor speeding 
automobiles can “raise the dust” 
on it. It has been treated with 


SOLVAY 


Granulated 


Calcium Chloride 


The Natural Dust Layer. A clean, 
white chemical salt, both odorless 
and harmless. A great economy 
in road maintenance, as it pro- 
tects against raveling and deterio- 
ration; satisfactory alike to horse- 
drawn vehicles, automobiles and 
pedestrians. 

“Solvay” is easy to apply, re- 
quiring no skilled labor. It comes in 
air-tight steel drums, ready for use.

horse-drawn vehicles. Since the truck can 
travel at a greater speed than horse-drawn 
flushers operate, an equal amount of water 
with this auto flusher covers a greater area

additional economy to cities where the cost of

A Dirt Mover of Varied Usefulness 


The Maney four-wheel scraper, made by the 
Baker Manufacturing Company, 503 Stanford 
Avenue, Springfield, Ill., meets the demand for 
a practical excavator of large capacity, with 
the portability of a two-wheeled scraper and 
yet accomplishing results equivalent to those 
of the steam shovel or the elevating grader. It 
is used in road building, street excavation, rail- 
road grading, quarry stripping, subdivision 
work, sod removing, clay pit excavation, snow 
removal, levee and canal construction and 
other branches of the dirt-removing industry. 
It is substantially built and has a capacity of 
one cubic yard. The operating costs are com- 
paratively low. Loading is done by a four- 
horse team or a tractor, the latter method 
usually resulting in one load per minute during 
actual operating time. The elimination of 
wheel holders and dump men, with the cor- 
responding saving in labor, is said to practic- 
ally offset the cost of additional power required 
for loading as compared with two-wheel 
scrapers. In dumping its load, the Maney 
spreads the dirt in layers of 6 inches and less 
The loaded scraper is ordinarily drawn by two 
horses; its shipping weight is 2,200 pounds

THE CITY MANAGER 


A New Profession | 








By Harry Aubrey Toulmin, Jr., J.D., F.S.S. 


| 
ORE than three hundred American cities have eliminated their 
M aldermen and mayors and have chosen less involved, less com- 

plicated and more adequate methods of government. The idea 
of employing an efficient professional municipal expert as a general man- 
ager of a city for the same purpose as a general manager of a privale 
corporation 1s selected, is a signal departure for local government in 
America. Mr. Toulmin, with first-hand information at his command, 
gives a complete summary of this new form of municipal government, as it 
has been adopted in many cities of the South and West with marked 
success, as well as by many commission government cities all over the 
country. This work goes so thoroughly into the advantages and disad- 


vantages of the commission and city government plans and into the actual 


workings of the city manager method in the foremost cities which have 
adopted it, that it is bound to prove a telling factor in the development

Keep your city clean 


The first important step in a “Civic Clean Up” is to keep 
paper and refuse off the street and out of the gutters. Provide 
a handy Majestic Refuse Receiver at various corners of your 
city and each citizen will use it for papers and refuse instead of 
littering up the sidewalk and streets. 


MATES TIC 


Refuse Receiver 
For City Streets and Park Boulevards 


The Majestic is strong, durable and ornamental. The 
can sets into an ingot iron receptacle and the contents are pro- 
tected from winds by iron top and lid. No papers or litter can 
be blown away and scattered. It is water-proof and with 
stands the severest elements. When can is filled it is easily 
lifted out for emptying. The Majestic Refuse Receivers 
should be included in every Civic Improvement.

THE AMERICAN CITY 








One Chamber of Commerce Member 
for Every Twenty-eight of Population 




















This is the average of the membership secured at Huntingdon, Pa. and Fulton, N. Y. 
On this basis a city of 100,000 people would have an organization of 3,500 members. 
While corresponding results may not be practically attainable in all communities, the 
achievements in Fulton and Huntingdon indicate that most cities—possibly your own 
among them—fall short of their possibilities. 


HUNTINGDON, PA. 


Early in February a small group of men who had confidence in Huntingdon and the 
possibilities before it, engaged us to come there to develop a strong Chamber of Com- 
merce. They told us frankly that conditions in Huntingdon were peculiarly difficult. 
While they appreciated the city’s strong inherent advantages—and there are many— 
they felt that it was infested with “knockers.’’ This condition had killed previous 
efforts toward effective co-operation. 

To-day this spirit is a thing of the past. Most of the men who were doing the 
“knocking’’ are among the strongest supporters of the Huntingdon Chamber of Com- 
merce. The others are not talking. Two hundred and ninety-two of Huntingdon’s 
strongest men have pledged themselves to pay $25 a year for three years to the support 


of the organization. 
FULTON, N. Y. 


The ‘Chamber of Commerce idea” was not a new one in Fulton. It had been tried 
and had failed; so the people of Fulton felt. For about five years Fulton had had a 
Chamber of Commerce. This organization was headed by public-spirited men who were 
sincerely interested in Fulton’s welfare. It was backed by over 200 of Fulton’s citizen 
But it had accomplished very little. 

It could accomplish little because it did not have the financial backing its success 
demanded. Its dues were $2.00 a year. Most people in Fulton regarded the prospect 
of securing anything higher than this, or at most $5.00, as little better than a fantastic 
dream. They could give many and excellent reasons to “prove” their belief. In the 
words of one man, when Mr. Wilson spoke of $25.00 dues at the first noon luncheon “the 
soup turned cold, and the meat actually froze to the plate.” 

To-day that spirit no longer exists. The Fulton Chamber of Commerce with 316 
members at $25 a year each is a fact. It has already started to “‘do things.” 








The list of members in each organization includes merchants, manufacturers, doctors, 
bankers, publishers, ministers, and others. Each Chamber represents its entire com- 
munity in the interests of the entire community. 





Next month we will have something to tell you about campaigns which are now 
being conducted in Jamestown, N. Y., and Muskogee, Okla.

Thirteen Big Watson Trailers 


like the one shown in the cut, are in use by the City of New York, 
Boro of Manhattan, at the Municipal Asphalt Plant. 























Wherever real trailers of the bottom dump type are wanted, there 
you will find Watsons. The tractor shown is a Saurer. 


First, the city officials bought two Watson trailers for handling asphalt. They tested 
them thoroughly in actual service. Then they bought eleven more 

The special chutes or pockets underneath the bottom doors are for asphalt patching pur- 
poses only. By this means any required quantity, however small, may be taken out with 
shovels—just as needed. The chutes for patching do not interfere in any way with the com- 
plete bottom dumping feature. The whole load or whatever is left of it, may be dumped 
instantly at any time 

Watson trailers are REAL trailers. You are not asked to experiment. Remember that 
we furnish these trailers with four wheels for use behind any motor truck. Also as two-wheel 
or semi-trailers similar to the one shown here for use with tractors such as the Saurer, Garford, 
Knox, Peerless, etc 

Better get posted on the Watson trailers. Let us give you a list of users. 
matter is interesting. Shall we send it?

Increasing the Freight Rate 


What would freight rates be if every Railroad CARRIED all its goods 
on locomotives? What Railroad could afford to buy enough locomotives 


to CARRY merchandise this way? 


Why do you CARRY goods this way in 


your motor truck, contrary to a basic law of power and efficiency—the law 
that you can PULL at least three times as much as you can CARRY? 


You expect to see locomotives pulling 
trains of cars. 


You expect to see motor trucks loaded 
up to the tops of their bodies. 


Operating on two absolutely different 
principles, you expect both to show simi- 
lar results in costs. 


The Fallacy of the Lonely Motor Truck 


Suppose your truck is rated at a ton and 
a half. That rating is for what you can 
pile on the body, springs and axles—not 
for what the truck can pull. 


Any good ton and a half truck is able to deliver five tons 
more on trailers with small increase in tire or fuel costs. 
Chis ratio will hold good for any size of truck 


The real business end of a truck is in the same place 
as the business end of a locomotive—at the draw-bar. 
One pound of draw-bar pull is worth eight pounds of carry 
I'wo hundred and fifty pounds at the draw-bar will pull a 
ton on any average road on a properly constructed trailer. 
Most good trucks have a draw-bar pull equal to one half 
their rated load capacity. Reduced to a unit factor, these 
trucks can thus pull four times as much as they can carry 

without interfering with their normal capacity. 





Troy Trailers Don’t Wear Out Truck Tires 


The load on the tires is the load that wears then 
The load behind the tires—the load on the trailer—hard 


affects them. Practical tests prove thi Nor dos 
trailer proportionately increase your gasoline or ele 
bill. The reason is that whether or not you hitch a tra 
to your truck, your power is there just the same; wit! 
the trailer you waste your draw-bar pull; wit 


this pull 


What Does It Mean to You to Triple Your 
Deliveries at the Present Cost? 


Troy Trailers are built specifically for motor-truck 
poses and conditions. The average possible 


motor truck efficiency with Troy Trailers is 300 per 
Whether it is more or less than this dpends on t 
ditions of service and use. If 300 per cent. mea 1 
thing in money to you, write us with a statement of how 
many trucks you operate, their size and make, the length 


and character of their trips, your present < 

other data as will enable us to tell you whether a V

HIGH QUALITY ENGINEERING INSTRUMENTS 
WITHOUT FANCY PRICE 
Murray Lee, an Engineer of Denver, Colo., writes, referring 
to our No. 50 Reconnoissance Transit: 
‘*T had no idea that such an instrument 
could be bought for the money.”’ 
The above statement can well be said of any Hanna Transit 
or Level. 
Manufactured in large quantities with up-to-date methods 
and machinery—hence QUALITY at a moderate price.

Baker Adjustable Circle Forms 


are especially designed to secure better results at far less expense. ‘They 


Save All Your 
Lumber Bills 


They are built of steel and will never warp or rot 
like wood—practically last indefinitely. 

No wooden forms are necessary, as the circle forms 
can be used either as straight or circle forms. 
This enables the form setter to connect them directly 
to straight forms no matter what distance from the 
beginning of the circle. 

More than that—they can be used interchange- 
ably for plain curbs, curb and gutter, road 
work, etc., and to splendid advantage on wind- 
ing roadways through parks or private grounds. 









Send for more information on these adjust- 
able circle forms. It will be worth your while.

Of Special 
Importance 


To Every Buyer of Machinery. 
There is something of special 
importance that vitally in- 
terests you. When you buy a 


Koelting Mixer 


you are backed up by the company’s policy and business principles to give you something more or some- 
thing better than you can secure elsewhere. Then, too, you are backed up by the company’s progressive 
policy to produce a quality machine with improved features that are far in advance of anything else. It 
is of vital interest to you, because we are giving you the latest improvements and best on the market— 
much better than you can secure elsewhere—something far more superior than heretofore offered. 





You will agree with us that you should use Koehring Mixers, 
because the quality of the mixer and the methods under 
which they are sold, as well as the broad guarantee and 
service you will secure, make it strictly to your interest to 
use only Koehrings. 


Investigate by asking for Catalogue No. “19-BB.”

A Lower Bid from the Undertaker 


“Yes,” said the specialist, as he stood at the 
bedside of the sick purchasing agent, “‘I can 
cure you.” 








What will it cost?’’ asked the sick man, faintly- 
‘Ninety-five dollars. "’ 
“You'll have to shade your price a little,” 
replied the purchasing agent, ‘‘I have a lower bid 
than that from the undertaker.”’ 











The Purchasing Agent’s line of reasoning in this story is 
responsible for a lot of poor asphalt pavements. You can 


always get a lower bid from the Undertaker, but is it the best 
bid? 


In the first instance you can’t get the best pavement for 
the least money. 





But in the long run a Trinidad Lake asphalt pavement 


gives more service for the money expended than any other 
pavement gives 


You get more paving satisfaction and longer service out 
of every dollar spent for a Trinidad pavement than can be 
obtained in any other way. 


Ask for “Evidence,”’ a record of 20-to-30-year-old Trinidad 
pavements.
