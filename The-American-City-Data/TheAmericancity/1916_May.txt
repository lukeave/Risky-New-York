Municipal Preparedness 
For Peace 


A unique opportunity for public 
service faces the city officials and civi« 
organizations of the United States. 


As soon as terms of peace shall be 
under serious consideration in Europe, 
a period of readjustment in American 
industries must inevitably begin. If 
met with unreasoning fear instead of 
wise forethought, there is little doubt 
that the problem will assume the seri- 
ougness of a panic, 


What can American municipalities 
do, in advance of such a crisis, towards 
becoming a steadying influence? 


THE AMERICAN CITY urges the 
immediate preparation and prompt 
adoption in every city of a three-year 
program of public improvements, in- 
volving: 


1) The continuance of normal pur- 
chases regardless of the war, and the 
carrying on of new work to meet imme- 
diate needs; 


2) The installation of improvements 
on an exceptionally large scale after 
peace has been declared. 


Such a program would have two sub- 
stantial results: it would help many 
cities to fit their stride to the onward 
march of the times in municipa! better- 
ment, and it would go far to offset the 
losses to capital and labor which might 
otherwise cccur in the United States 
during the readjustment period. 


The suggested procedure is outlined 
on the first editorial page of this issue.

Fear, or Forethought? 


With growing assurance, optimists and alarmists are telling 
us what is going to happen in America after the end of the Euro- 
pean war. By the optimists we are informed that the United 
States will then enter upon an era of the greatest prosperity 
ever known. With equal certainty the alarmists proclaim the hope- 
less impotence of American industry as a competitor for the 
world’s markets against the crippled labor of debt-burdened 
Europe. 

Which shall we look forward to—cowardly panic or coura- 
geous progress? Speaking for THe American City, we believe 
that the answer depends not on fate, but on the vision and will 
of the American people. We see no reason to anticipate, on the 
one hand, that America can find ultimate profit in the awful de- 
struction of life and property in the warring countries; nor do 
we fear, on the other hand, that peace in Europe need spell panic 
in America. But we believe that we do foresee very clearly a 
period of industrial readjustment throughout the United States 
which, if not approached with sane courage, will mean a serious 
setback to industry and commerce. The time has arrived for 
nation-wide preparedness for peace. 

On the front cover of this issue is suggested a plan which the 
municipal officials and civic organizations throughout the United 
States have the power to make effective. The suggestion involves 
exceptional expenditures of municipal funds during the year or 
two following the end of the war, such expenditures to be in 
accordance with plans begun now and based on the fundamental 
needs of each city. 

The new “Model City Charter” of the National Municipal 


Rat at tat pee tas Cen eR CR pC peep pea Een eae te 


























THE AMERICAN CITY 


League, referred to elsewhere in this issue, provides for the crea- 
tion in each municipality of a city planning board, one of the func- 
tions of which shall be to submit annually “a program for improve- 
ment to the city plan year by year during the three years next 
ensuing, with estimates of the cost thereof and recommendations 
as to how the cost shall be met.” 

THe AMERICAN Ciry recommends that this provision—writ- 
ten, of course, as was the entire Model Charter, with normal times 
in view—be amplified and made immediately effective by ordi 
nance in every city now possessing the legal power to do so. The 
amplification suggested is a three-year program, not merely of 
improvements to the city plan in the narrow sense, but of improve- 
ments in municipal structures, streets and public works generally, 
and in the physical equipment of municipal departments. In all 
cities where there is no city planning board or commission to 
which the preparation of this program might be referred, we 
urge the immediate appointment of such a body, or that the Mayor 
request the codperation of an unofficial committee, to be ap- 
pointed by him or by the leading commercial-civic organization 
of the city. Such a plan, if wisely prepared and given proper pub- 
licity, would secure popular approval for: 

(1) Public works needed for normal progress during the 
next three years, to be carried on regardless of conditions 
abroad ; 

(2) Certain other desirable improvements for which public 
opinion might not otherwise be ready till several years hence, but 
whose installation after the end of the European war would help 
to steady American industry during the readjustment period. 

This suggestion is not made with a view to maintaining by 
artificial means the present abnormal prices of metals and other 
commodities. Such a result would not be desirable from the 
point of view of the consuming public, nor, indeed, of most manu- 
facturers. The end of the war is certain to be accompanied by 
falling prices; and falling prices will be a calamity only if they 
fall too far, with the inevitable destruction of confidence in the 
future among business men. The danger lies in the disinclina- 
tion of buyers to place orders on a falling market. When quo- 
tations can be secured at fairly normal figures, the municipalities 
should be ready to act as a steadying influence by the letting of 
large contracts. If the improvements thus to be constructed shall 
result in more rapid municipal progress, besides helping to prevent 
a post-bellum panic, the program will reflect great credit on the 
officials and citizens through whose present foresight it will then 
be put into action.

A Plan for the Protection of the Miami Valley 
District from Flood Damage 
By Arthur E. Morgan 


Chief Engineer, The Miami Conservancy District, Dayton, Ohio 


HE Miami Valley always has been 
T subject to floods. One of the great- 
est occurred in 1805, less than ten 

years after the first settlement of the val- 
ley. The greatest of which we have de- 
tailed knowledge, but not necessarily the 
greatest that may occur, was that of March, 
1913. Many other floods occurred between 
these two dates; small 
ones frequently, and 
greater ones at long in- 
tervals. What has hap- 
pened in the past indi- 
cates generally what will 
happen in the future, 
though our period of rec- 
ords is so short that we 
cannot safely draw conclu- 
sions as to the frequency 
of great floods in the fu- 
ture. The particular mag- 
nitude of the 1913 flood 
was accidental. Slight 
differences in weather 
conditions would have re- 
sulted in a flood either 
larger or smaller. Floods 
will occur somewhat 
larger, some will be only 
half as large. The next 
great flood probably will 
differ materially in size 
from the last, and floods 
half as great or two-thirds 
as great as that of 1913 
may reasonably be ex- 
pected to occur on an 
average with much 
greater frequency than 
floods of the magnitude 
of that of 1913. The Mi- 
ami Valley, in its present 
condition, would suffer 
very great damage from a 
flood half as great as that 
of 1913—a damage doubt- 
less exceeding in money 
loss the total cost of com- 








plete protection for the valley. So it is not 
against the greatest floods alone that pro- 
tection is needed. 

Chis being the case, it is necessary to de- 
cide how great a flood the cities of the val- 
ley should be protected from. Shall an 
improvement he planned to control a flood 
half as great as that of 1913, with works

greatest possible flood, with works that will 
be adequate under all possible conditions? 
The answer to this question depends upon 
the cost of different degrees of protection, 
the values to be protected, and the magni- 
tude of the loss that will occur whenever 
work planned for partial protection fails. 
It should be borne in mind that while the 
average frequency of a flood of a given 
magnitude may be fairly definite, the inter- 
val between any two successive floods will 
not be the average interval, but will be 


and cities, levees, retard- 
ing basins, and cut-off channels. Only after 
every possibility had been carefully worked 
out was the proposed plan chosen as the 
most feasible and practicable. 


Synopsis of the Recommended Plan 

The recommended pian consists of a se- 
ries of five retarding basins, located as 
shown on the accompanying map, supple- 
mented by channel improvements through 
the cities. The retarding basins will be 


formed by dams built across the valleys of 














May, 1916 


the Miami, Mad and Stillwater Rivers, and 
on Twin and Loramie Creeks. Each dam 
will have permanent openings through its 
base through which the ordinary flow of 
the river and the flow during ordinary 
freshets will pass unimpeded. During large 
floods the water which cannot pass through 
the outlet conduits will be held back tem- 
porarily in the basins above the dams. The 
conduits are proportioned so that no more 
water can pass through them than can be 
carried safely in the improved channels 
through the cities below. In this manner 
the runoff of a flood like that of 1913, 
which lasted but two or three days, would 
be distributed over a period of about two 
weeks and its height would be correspond- 
ingly reduced. 

During the 1913 flood about 1,415,000 
acre feet of water fell over the drainage 
areas above the proposed dams. (An acre 
foot is the amount of water required to 
cover an acre one foot deep, or 43,560 cubic 
feet.) The total capacity of the retarding 
basins to the spillway level is 840,000 acre 
feet, or 60 per cent of the total rainfall of 
the 1913 flood. During the beginning of a 
flood, and again during its ending, when the 
flow is large, but not more than the chan- 
nels will carry, nearly all will pass through 
the openings in the dams, and little or none 
will be stored. This leaves nearly the whole 
of the storage capacity of the basins avail- 
able for cutting off the excess of flow when 
the main part of the flood is passing down 
the valley. Assuming, for the moment, that

during a flood like that of 1913 all the 
rainfall would run off the ground surface, 
and none would be stored in the soil to run 
off slowly, there would remain 575,000 acre 
feet, or 40 per cent of the rainfall, to pass 
through the conduits. The conduits are 
planned of such size, however, that a con- 
siderably larger part of the flood flow as- 
sumed above would pass through them dur- 
ing this imterval, so that a smaller part 
would be stored in the reservoirs, and the 
water consequently would not rise to the 
spillway level. As the river channels will 
be filled approximately to their full ca- 
pacity during the entire time of the flood, 
it is only the peak of the 
flood, the part that the rivers 
cannot carry, which must be 
held back temporarily in the 
retarding basins. By improv- 
ing the river channels 
through the cities as much 
as is reasonably practicable, 
the rate at which the water 
can be allowed to pass 
through the conduits is in- 
creased, and the amount that 
must be held back in the ba- 
sins is lessened. 

In general, the greatest 
rate of flow through the 
cities below the retarding 
basins in case of a storm like 
that of 1913 would be ap- 
proximately half as great as 
the unmodified flow in 1913.

Phe channel at Dayton when improved and 
enlarged will have sufficient capacity to 
carry somewhat less than half as much 
water as the maximum 1913 flow, and that 
at Hamilton to carry somewhat more than 
half; the remainder in each case being 
cared for by retarding basin control. 

The highest dam is that at Englewood, 
120 feet above the valley, and the lowest 
is the Huffman Dam, 65 feet high. For the 
construction of all the dams, a total of 
about 9,000,000 cubic yards of earth and 
about 190,000 cubic yards of concrete will 
be necessary. 

The local flood control works at the va- 
rious cities will consist of widening and 
deepening channels, correcting sharp bends, 
raising and lengthening bridges, protecting 
the sides and bottoms of channels with con- 
crete at critical points, and building levees. 

Construction can proceed on all of the 
channel improvements and on nearly all of 
the dam construction at one time. Three 
years of active construction work should be 
sufficient for the substantial completion of 
the project. 

The following table gives the estimate of 
the total cost of each dam, and of each local 
channel improvement, the total of which is 
the estimated cost of the construction of 
the works included in the plan; following 
this total are items for public service relo- 
cations and damages, for real estate pur- 
chases and easements, for administration 
and general expense, and for taxes. To 
these is added an item for contingencies to 
cover possible changes in the cost of cement 
and other materials, of labor and of procur- 
ing rights-of-way. The total is the esti-

quoted, has been published by the Miami Conservancy 
District in three printed volumes. Volume I (price, 
25 cents) includes: first, a condensed selection of some 
of the most pertinent and important facts from the 
great volume of technical and engineering data which 
has been accumulated in the course of the preparation 
of the plan; second, a statement of the more impor- 
tant principles governing the development of the plan: 
third, a more detailed description of the plan itself. 
Volume II comprises a list of the property affected by 
the plan, while Volume III contains forms of con- 
tract and specifications and detailed estimates of cost. 
Another volume, covering technical reports of investi- 
gations, will probably be published at a later date 





Cincinnati’s Training Course for Municipal Playground Directors 


Cincinnati will be able to train its own 
playground directors and physical culture 
teachers upon the completion of the Wom- 
an’s Building and Gymnasium at the Uni- 
versity of Cincinnati. Plans are being for- 
mulated to organize a department of phys- 
ical education in the University for both 
men and women, and, in codperation with 
the physical director and his assistants and 
the playground workers of the city, a sys- 
tematic course of study covering four years 
will be instituted. The opportunity, it is 
hoped, will appeal to students. 


The University will be a pioneer in this 
important field, since there are few univer- 
sities in America which offer so elaborate 
a training as is contemplated. The Board 
of Education of Cincinnati has already au- 
thorized an assistant director in charge of 
physical education who will instruct the 
women of the University and also the girls 
in the high schools and the upper grades 
of the elementary schools. It is further- 


more planned to secure a director in charge 
of physical education both in the University 
and in the city schools.

Hand Flushing—Its Place in the Street 


Cleaning Field 


By Raymond W. Parlin 


Engineer with the New York Bureau of Municipal Research 


HIS article has two objects in view: 


1. To point out some of the advan- 

tages and limitations of hand flushing; 

2. To present for the benefit of others a few 
f the facts and conclusions secured from a 
tudy of New York City conditions and the 
development of new equipment and procedure 


‘Pavement W ashing Eliminates Fine Dust 
and Mud Nuisance 

Up to the present time the only method 
of combating the fine dust and mud nuis- 
ance which every street cleaning depart- 
ment must meet in the care of city pave- 
ments is by means of some form of pave- 
ment washing. While it is expected that 
vacuum cleaning equipment may be devel- 
oped which will satisfactorily meet the fine 
dust conditions, so far no equipment of this 
nature has been developed which has met 
with general approval of street cleaning ad- 
ministrators, and it is hardly to be expected 
that such equipment will ever effectively 
remove mud. 

Pavement washing equipment may be di- 
vided into two general classes: 

1. Scrubbing equipment 

2. Flushing equipment 


Scrubbing Equipment Limited to Smooth 
Pavements 
Scrubbing equipment is practically lim- 


ited to the ordinary squeegees, which may 
be horse-drawn or automobile-driven. This 
type of equipment consists of a heavy roller 
equipped with rubber fins, the roller being 
attached behind or under a water tank. 
The roller is rotated against the pavement 
after the street is heavily sprinkled and 
scrubs the surface thoroughly wherever it 
touches, driving the mud wave or stroke 
toward the gutter; there the heavy material 
settles, the water drains off, and it is pos- 
sible to pick up the dirt from the surface 
of the street. (See Photo 1.) 

his equipment by its very nature is prac- 
tically limited to smooth pavement in good 
repair, such as asphalt, asphalt block, wood 
block and perhaps concrete. On such streets 
it produces very effective results with a 
limited use of water. 


Hand Flushing vs. Mechanical Flushing 
Flushing equipment is naturally divided 
into two classes: 


1. Hand flushing equipment 


> 


2. Mechanical flushing equipment 

The favorable characteristics of hand 
flushing may be outlined as follows: 

1. Low first cost of equipment and therefore 
low fixed charges 

2. Almost universal adaptability to all street 
cleaning conditions, particularly to special and 
emergency conditions, such 











as snow cleaning; heavy or 
spotty cleaning; work on 
very rough pavements; and 
work in heavy traffic, on 
small jobs and in inacces 
sible places where mechat 
ical equipment cannot be 
operated 

3. Require but limited in 
telligence to secure good 
operation 

4. Requires very little 
storage space for equip- 
ment 

5. Equipment has a low 
cost of upkeep, and repairs 
are easily made

opment as follows: 

1. Ordinary sprinkling

valves wide open 

2. Horse-drawn flushers 
utilizing air pressure (See

3. Horse-drawn  flushers 
with gasolene-driven pumps 
(See Photo 3) 

4. Automobile flushers 
(See Photo 4) with either

pumps driven either direct- 
ly from the automobile en-

characteristics : 

1. Requires more water on ordinary work 
than mechanical flushing. 

2. More expensive than mechanical flushing 
if in regular use on large areas where ma 
chines could be used more than one shift 
day. 

3. Requires hydrant spacing not exceeding 
joo feet for good results 

j. Requires good street drainage 

In general it may be stated that hand 
flushing fulfills the requirements of small 
communities completely, is always a very 
excellent auxiliary to mechanical flushing, 
and may be under some conditions even 
more economical than mechanical flushing, 
even in large cities. 

The Field of Mechanical Equipment 

For regular flushing over large areas it 
appears now that the ideal equipment for 
such work may include: 


per 


AIR 





gine, separately driven, or 
driven by means of an elec- 
tric motor which secures 
its power from the engine, 
or in case of an electric au- 
tomobile directly from the 


CLOSED TANK 


storage battery 

5. Trailer machines which may be attached 
to an automobile tractor 

For street railway work the development 
has been as follows: 


1. Ordinary street railway sprinklers with 
valves wide open 

2. Special flushing cars with rigidly attached 
nozzles supplied with pressure by a pump (See 
Photo 5) 

3. Special flushing cars with a flushing noz- 
zle attached to a swinging arm which enables 
the car to clean a wide street (See Photo 6) 

Hand Flushing Equipment 

Hand flushing equipment may be divided 
into two classes: 

1. Ordinary hose, with nozzle and carrier or 
reel 

2. Special pipe lines and other elaborate 
equipment 


The latter class may be best illustrated by

New York Had Been 

Using 2'2-Inch Hose 

Up to this time the de- 
partment of street clean- 
ing had been using ordi- 
nary 2'%-inch fire hose 
and 1%-inch nozzles. 
Che equipment was car- 
ried the regular 
sweeper’s can carrier or 
dragged over the pave- 
ment from place to place 
by two or three sweep- 
ers. That this equip- 
ment was not only ill- 
adapted to the work, but 
heavy, unsightly and li- 
able to cause rapid de- 
terioration of the 
on account of the sharp 
bends which were neces- 


on 


hose 


sary, can easily be im- 
agined after observing 
Photo 11, which shows a 
sample of this old equip- 
ment. 

Investigations made 
by Mr. Wagner, an 
gineer from the Depart- 
ment of Water Supply, 
Gas and Electricity, in- 
dicated that: 


en- 


1. An average of 1,800 
gallons of water was be- 
ing used per thousand 


square yards of pavement 
cleaned 


2. Other cities 
using smaller 
hose and nozzles with ap- 
parent satisfaction 


were 
sizes of 


3. Experiments made 
with 1%-inch and 2-inch 
hose and small nozzles in- 
dicated that the work of 
cleaning could be properly 
done with from 370 to 660 
gallons per 1,000 square 
yards on asphalt. 


As a result, it was rec- 
ommended by the engi- 
neer that the department 
of street cleaning adopt 
1™%-inch equipment, 


which would be much 
easier to handle and 
save more than two- 


thirds of the water then 
used. 

















May, 1916 


Experiments Lead to 
Adoption of 2-Inch Hose 

The recommendation 
did not agree with the 
experience of the officers 
of the department of 
street cleaning, several 
of whom had tried the 
small equipment. The 
claim was almost uni- 
versally made among 
these men that the use 
of so small a hose and 
nozzle would make it 
impossible for men to 
cover the ground they 
were then covering and 
would make the work 
very expensive. 

Thus developed two 
points of view, one look- 
ing primarily at the 
waste of water and the 
other at the waste of 
time. Between these it 
became necessary to run 
a second set of experi- 
ments to determine the 
size of equipment which 
would be cheapest to op- 
erate from the taxpay- 
ers’ or general city 
viewpoint, taking into 
account both the cost of 
labor and the cost of 
water. 

This second set of ex- 
periments, conducted al- 
ternately upon 1'%4-inch 
ind 2-inch equipment, 
resulted in the selection 
if the 2-inch equipment 
as standard for the city. 
\ttention was at the 
same time called to the 
possibility of using the 
smaller size with equally 
good results wherever 
the pressures at the hy- 
drants were in excess of 
50 pounds per square 
inch. 


Equipment and Pro- 
cedure Greatly Improved 

As a result of these 
and further experiments,

principles appear to be established. 

1. That the economical size of equip- 
ment is dependent upon the hydrant pres- 
sures available and the length of hose used. 

2. That when the pressure at the nozzle 
is in excess of 25 pounds per square inch, 
water is delivered through a 44-inch nozzle 
faster than it can be properly used by two 
men and that it is accompanied by exces- 
sive splashing. 

3. That when the pressure at the nozzle is 
less than 18 pounds per square inch, water 
is not delivered fast enough to keep up 
with the men nor with force enough to 
enable them to do effective work. 

4. That the smallest size hose which will 
give pressures at the nozzle between 18 and 
25 pounds is the most economical for use. 

5. That better results can be secured by 
spraying ahead as far as the stream will 
reach, to give the material on the street a 
preliminary soaking prior to the direct 
flushing, than can be secured by the direct 
flushing of a dry pavement. 

6. That larger quantities of water are 
required to clean rough pavement than 
smooth, and therefore a slightly larger noz- 
zle may be used to advantage. (It is esti- 
mated that a 34-inch will be satisfactory 
for asphalt and a 1-inch for rough Belgian 
block. ) 

7. That shut-off nozzles are necessary 
whenever working in traffic, both to save 
water and to prevent accidents. 

8. That where water mains are large 
enough for proper domestic and fire sup- 
ply, flushing will not interfere with the or- 
dinary household use. 

g. That a hose reel will enable the gangs 
to do more work with the same expenditure 
of energy and at the same time lengthen the 
life of the hose. 

10. That by the adoption of procedure 
which prevents any “back tracking” of the 
equipment, over four miles of walking can 
be saved per gang per eight-hour day in 
covering a given amount of street, as com- 
pared with the procedure commonly used 
in the past, which saving enables the gangs 
to do more work. 

As a result of the studies and conclusions 
reached, a new hose reel, new hydrant 
equipment, and improved procedure were 
adopted by the department and put into 
effect. 

The procedure may be outlined as start- 
ing with the hose reeled with the noz- 


Vor. XIV, No. 5 


zle on top, commencing to unreel when at 
a distance equal to the length of the hose 
from the hydrant, unreeling toward the 
hydrant, placing the reel on the sidewalk 
near the hydrant, flushing from the point 
nearest the nozzle past the hydrant and as 
far as the hose will reach beyond the hy- 
drant, and reeling from the hydrant toward 
the nozzle, thus completing the area served 
by a single hydrant. Whenever moving 
hose, the “hydrant man” is required to pick 
it up in loops and drag it ahead in such a 
way that it will not cross other loops, and 
he is expected to keep a loop at the nozzle 
end, even with or slightly ahead of the 
“nozzle man,” so that the latter will be free 
to move without assistance at all times. 


Results of New York Studies 

The results of the studies can best be in- 
dicated by the illustrations numbered 12 to 
17, which show the improved reducer which 
can be put on the hydrant without the use 
of a wrench; the improved reel with its tool 
box, third wheel, and special arrangement 
for receiving the reducer in winding on the 
reel; the method of placing the hose along 
the curb or in the gutter out of the way of 
traffic; the method of direct flushing; the 
method of moving the hose from place to 
place during flushing; the advantage of the 
shut-off nozzle, and the method of reeling. 

While previous to the adoption of the 
new methods and procedure it was seldom 
possible to flush effectively much over 25,- 
000 square yards of pavement per day, it is 
common now for a two-man gang to cover 
from 30,000 to 45,000 square yards in an 
eight-hour day, making as many as 45 or 
50 connections to the hydrants. This means 
unit costs for labor and equipment of 11.9 
cents to 17.8 cents per 1,000 square yards. 

The first cost of the equipment is ap- 
proximately as follows: 


Three 50-ft. lengths 2-inch rubber hose at 54c. $81.00 
One %-inch shut-off nozzle. ............+. ees 7.00 
One 2%-inch to 2-inch reducer, hand swivel

(Rubber-covered hose is preferable to cotton jacket 
hose for this work.) 


There seems no reason why any city can- 
not secure the same results with similar 
equipment if it so desires, and it is hoped 
that this article may be of assistance in 
enabling other cities to profit by New 
York’s experience.

Public Comfort Stations 


Their Location, Plan, Construction, Equipment and Care—Above-Ground versus 


Underground Stations 


Financial Considerations 


By Dr. Wm. Paul Gerhard 


Consulting Engineer, New York City 


O less an authority on public health 
matters than Prof. W. T. Sedgwick, 
in his annual presidential address at 

the Rochester meeting of the American 
Public Health Association in September, 
1915, declared that “probably the most flag- 
rant failure in American sanitation to-day 
is the almost universal lack of public con- 
venience or comfort stations in American 
cities and towns.” Concluding his address, 
he stated: “Failure to provide public toilet 
facilities in our towns and cities is to fail 
in one of the very elements of sound public 
health service.” In the light of these words 
it would seem worth while to devote some 
space in THe AmerICcAN City to a further 
discussion of this seemingly trite subject. 

Convenience or comfort stations are pub- 
lic buildings or structures intended to af- 
ford toilet conveniences for either one, or 
else for both sexes. The latter type has a 
complete installation of water-closets, uri- 
nals, lavatories, drinking fountains and 
other toilet accessories, also rest rooms, and 
sometimes other public utilities, while the 
former are usually restricted to urinal fix- 
tures. 

\ll up-to-date municipalities should take 
pride in providing a sufficient number of 
such utilitarian structures, not only for 
their citizens and for many city employes 
whose work is outdoors, but also for their 
visitors. 

The construction and design of a comfort 
station present at times peculiar problems, 
and its engineering features, such as the 
sanitation, the lighting, the ventilation and 
the waterproofing of walls and floors, are 
naturally of prime importance. It is there- 
fore advisable to have such stations planned 
by competent sanitary engineers, who may 
associate with them architects or architec- 
tural designers to satisfy the esthetic re- 
quirements which often arise. 


Location 
Structures of this kind should be lo- 
cated, first of all, in those business districts 


where people congregate at certain periods 
of the day in large numbers, and, second, 
wherever there appears to be a lack of the 
commonly accepted substitutes, by which | 
have reference to the toilet rooms of hotels, 
office buildings, railroad stations and de- 
partment stores. 

The points in the city plan where the 
main arteries of traffic cross each other 
would seem to be those which ought to be 
given the preference. Street intersections 
and open spaces in the city plan usually 
offer favorable sites, likewise the public 
markets and public buildings, such as city 
halls, court houses and public libraries. In 
the case of these buildings the comfort sta- 
tions should be planned with independent 
entrances from the sidewalk, because other- 
wise the legitimate traffic in the buildings 
might be unduly congested and interfered 
with. In connection with street railway 
transfer or waiting stations, such buildings 
might be erected by the municipality under 
a special agreement with the street railway 
company. This is often the case in Euro- 
pean cities when the street railways are 
owned and operated by the city. 

Other points where they would be of the 
greatest service to the people are the sub- 
way stations, the public city squares, the 
parks and playgrounds, the recreation piers, 
the public bath-houses, the sea-bathing es- 
tablishments and the cemeteries. 

In selecting suitable locations, any pos- 
sible objections from mercantile establish- 
ments should be given due consideration. 
Cases may also arise where property own- 
ers will raise the claim that a public com- 
fort station would cause a depreciation in 
the value of their properties. Mere preju- 
dice should be firmly and judiciously met, 
and objections to an otherwise proper 
scheme set aside, unless they are good and 
valid. 


Objectionable Types 
Before taking up the description of ap- 
proved types of comfort stations, a few

countries at the public stairways, at corners 
of buildings, including even the cathedrals, 
at angles of bridges, and other places, hard- 
ly deserve even a passing remark. How 
any enlightened community can for a mo- 
ment tolerate such abominations, and how 
it can permit the waste to be disposed of 
by letting it run across the sidewalk into 
the street gutter, must remain forever a 
matter beyond comprehension. 
Objectionable types like the above and 
others have led some well-meaning people

to conclude that such stations should be put 
“out of sight,” and hence that underground 
stations are preferable. But I shall be able 
to demonstrate further on that there is ab- 
solutely no good reason why an above- 
ground station cannot be so designed as to 
be attractive, yet unobtrusive. 

In some cities one finds damp, dark and 
ill-ventilated stations, containing only the 
crudest toilet facilities, some of them un- 
ground, others at street corners, and it is to ’ 
such places as these that a recent report in 
the Canadian Sanitary Engineer must have 
reference when it says: 

“The comfort station which shamefacedly 
hides itself underground, or in a corner, is

left to be used only by the lower class of the 
population. City councils are apt to deny to 
such places a proper appropriation for main- 
tenance. The riff-raff who form the majority 
of the patrons bring to the place the filthy 
habits of their lives, and thereby make the 
work of maintenance more difficult and more 
expensive.” 

Approved Types of Comfort Stations 

We may distinguish (1) small comfort 
stations, which provide only urinal accom- 
modations, with possibly one or two lava- 
tories, and (2) complete stations with 
water-closet, urinal and lavatory accommo- 
dations, with sometimes pay compartments 
and other accessories. 

The first-named types hardly exist in any 
of our cities, yet there is not the slightest 
doubt that they are a real necessity and 
that they are very much wanted. Such 
smaller stations can be built at a very much 
lower initial cost, yet they can be made 
architecturally inoffensive and attractive to 
the eye, and, what is of far greater impor- 
tance, they can be operated at a very low 
annual cost of maintenance, since they re- 
quire only a minimum of attendance. Euro- 
pean cities have long ago recognized their 
necessity, and it is my personal view that 
in the larger cities of this country the next 
step should be to pay much more attention 
than heretofore to the erection of a larger 
number of smaller stations. I should not 
be doing my subject justice if I were not 
to lay special emphasis on these facts. 

The more complete type of comfort sta- 
tion may be subdivided into (a) above- 
ground and (b) underground stations. 


Above-Ground Stations 

Above-ground stations are not very nu- 
merous in the United States, but both in 
France and in Germany they are the pre- 
ferred type. To me the principal advan- 
tage, from a sanitary point of view, of the 
above-ground station appears to lie in the 
fact that the building is sure to be well- 
ventilated and to receive sunlight and out- 
side fresh air, nature’s best disinfectants, 
in abundance. It is well-known that plenty 
of light is the greatest foe to dirt, uncleanli- 
ness and slovenliness. Those who have 
made careful sanitary inspections of such 
places will appreciate the force of this re- 
mark. A further considerable advantage is 
that the cellar under the building becomes 
available for the necessary heating appa- 
ratus, and for the numerous plumbing waste 


THE AMERICAN CITY 451 


and supply pipes, traps, cleanouts and other 
fittings, thus keeping them accessible for 
repairs, or to remove stoppages, and under 
the complete control of the attendant. 
Where a rest or emergency room is in- 
cluded in the features of the station, a much 
more cheerful and useful room can be pro- 
vided if the main floor is above ground. 

It is true that some study should be given 
so as not to have an above-ground station 
too conspicuous, but on the other hand 
there is no reason why it should be an 
architectural monstrosity. The outer walls 
can with a very slight effort be embellished 
with climbing vines and flowers, and the 
building may be partly hidden by attractive 
shrubbery, as numerous examples in Ger- 
man cities prove. 

Among the disadvantages I should men- 
tion that the city street plan is sometimes 
unfavorable, rendering suitable sites dif- 
ficult to find, especially so in the congested 
districts, also that such a building in some 
cases would prove to be a real detriment to 
a neighborhood. Such facts would point to 
the desirability of building an underground 
station in such a locality. 


Underground Stations 

It is claimed by some that underground 
stations are more economical in construc- 
tion, but this assertion may well be doubted 
when it is considered that in all such cases 
one has to contend with increased difficul- 
ties in providing adequate ventilation and 
ample lighting, and in making the walls and 
floors of the underground structure per- 
fectly waterproof. Nor should the all-im- 
portant matter of proper sewerage be over- 
looked. Where drainage facilities are in- 
adequate, or the street sewer is at an insuf- 
ficient depth, recourse must be had to pump- 
ing, and while the mechanical difficulties of 
a pumping installation are not insurmount- 
able, I do not share the view that “pump- 
ing the sewage is a simple and ready solu- 
tion.” Many of the toilet rooms of the New 
York subway stations dispose of their sew- 
age by automatic sewage ejectors, and 
quite often in the past the public has found 
these toilet rooms “closed and out of order.” 

Numerous stations in English cities and 
examples of recently erected underground 
stations in American cities show that it is 
possible to make them architecturally ac- 
ceptable and sanitary; but where it is pos- 
sible to construct them above ground, as in

the parks and in residen- 
tial districts, it is in my 
judgment decidedly better 
to do so. Parts of un- 
derground stations which 
necessarily show above 
ground should always be 
made attractive in appear- 
ance. 
Plan 


The large comfort sta- 
tions are always planned 
to comprise two distinct 
sections, one for men, the 
other for women. The 
plan should be as simple 
and open as possible, and 
there should be wide pas- 
sageways to prevent any 
congestion during hours 
of greatest use. In the 
men’s section there should 
be a sufficient number of 
water-closets, urinals and lavatories, also 
one slop-sink and a drinking fountain. The 
urinals, being the fixtures most used, should 
be placed nearest to the entrance, and 
ample width should be given to each urinal 
stall. If possible, the fixtures should be 
located against the walls, as this helps the 
attendant in overseeing the place. There 
should be back of the fixtures a so-called

ing tanks, the pipes, valves and other fit- 
tings. A plan with fixtures standing back- 
to-back is not so good, as it interferes with 
a ready oversight of the station. 

Statistics having shown that not more 
than 15 to 20 per cent of the users of sta- 
tions are women, it follows that the women’s 
section should have a much smaller number 
of fixtures and that the floor space required 
need not be so large. The fixtures provided 
are water-closets, lava- 
tories, slop-sink and a 
drinking fountain. If a 
rest or emergency room is 
included, it is usual to put 
this on the women’s side. 
Space should also be pro- 
vided, if the station is an 
underground one, for the 
heating apparatus, the 
ventilating apparatus, and 
for an attendant’s tool and 
locker room. 

In addition to the fix- 
tures for free use by the 
public, some stations pro- 
vide a limited number of 
pay toilet compartments, 
securing greater privacy 
in use and offering greater 
cleanliness or a_ higher 
grade of fixtures. The 
question whether or not

to provide such pay compartments de- 
pends upon several factors, such as the 
character of the city district, the nearness 
or distance from hotels, etc. In some com- 
fort stations the pay compartments have 
brought in a considerable revenue, which 
helps to reduce the cost of maintenance,

patronage that the pay feature had to be 
abandoned. 

The provision of a cellar is generally not 
feasible in an underground station, but for 
above-ground stations a cellar is always 
desirable, for reasons already given. 

In planning the approaches to a comfort 
station the aim should be, in all types, to 
keep the entrances for men and for women 
as far from each other as 
possible. The entrances 
should be conspicuously 
lettered, or, better, should 
be provided with univer- 
sally adopted marks or 
signs designating respec- 
tively the men’s and the 
women’s sides. 

Entrance steps for un- 
derground stations should, 
if practicable, be covered 
so that the steps may not 
become slippery with ice 
in winter weather. Strong 
hand rails should always 
be provided and the stairs 
should be well-lighted. 


Construction 
For the proper mainte- 
nance of the building it is 
essential that its construc- 
tion, as well as its equip- 
ment, should be absolute-

are among the most suit- 

able materials for wall 

finish. The floors should be waterproof 
and finished in unglazed tiles or in mosaic 
work. They should be graded to one or 
more points, at which floor drains should 
be provided for proper drainage. Dark 
marble and all kinds of slate should be 
avoided for compartment partitions. These 
should be always raised from the floor. No 
woodwork is permissible in such places ex- 
cept the wooden doors, and these should be 
just large enough to afford privacy. White 


enameled steel doors would be an improve-

ment, as wooden doors are apt to warp 
from the dampness. 

In some comfort stations doors ar 
omitted entirely except at the pay com- 
partments. Even the wooden toilet seats 
may be dispensed with by using fixtures 
with integral porcelain seats. 

Plumbing fixtures should, as far as pos- 
sible, be attached to the walls by strong 
fastenings and wall plates, thus leaving the 
entire floor under the fixtures free anc

doubted whether a high-grade finish of all 
metal work, such as polished nickel-plating, 
is desirable. I hold the view that, in the 
interest of economy in construction, and 
to reduce the labor of keeping the metal 
work bright, it would be a better practice 
to use rough brass and galvanized iron for 
pipes, fittings and traps, and to enamel 
paint them with best white or cream enamel 
paint. 
Equipment 

The equipment should, ‘in general, be such 
as to “create an atmosphere of absolute 
cleanliness and due regard for decorum.” 
Cleanly habits should be encouraged by pro-

Another mistake to be avoided is to pro- 
vide any toilet accessories used by more 
than one person, for they are apt to become 
disease-spreaders. Accordingly, roller tow- 
els, drinking cups or glasses, combs, hair 
and nail brushes, cakes of soap, and so 
forth, should be absolutely prohibited. The 
essential supplies required are toilet paper, 
liquid or powdered soap, paper towels, and 
individual drinking cups, though the latter 
are not needed when bubble fountains are 
installed,

viding at least one lavatory in urinal sta- 
tions, and several in the more complete 
stations, if possible with hot water and 
soap. On the women’s side the provision 
of a sanitary receiver for soiled napkins 
will go far toward preventing the stoppage 
of water-closet fixtures. 

I repeat the assertion heretofore made 
that the tendency in the past has been, not 
only to provide buildings of unnecessarily 
large dimensions, but also to install too 
many fixtures, thus making both first cost 
and the item of maintenance unduly high. 
I consider a station with 10 closets for men, 
5 closets for women, I0 urinals, 3 lavatories 
on each side, and with 2 drinking fountains, 
to be amply large for highly populated city 
districts. For the residential districts, for 
parks, ete., the stations should have not 
more than half the above number of fix- 
tures, 


tures. Fixtures of the strongest, most dur- 
able and most sanitary type should be se- 
lected, for they are subject to almost con- 
tinuous and often rough usage. Pure white 
glazed earthen fixtures, with no embossing 
or decoration, set in pure white compart- 
ments, foster a feeling of decency and aid 
in inducing cleanly habits. To frustrate 
the ever-present danger of an abuse of the 
fixtures, they should have no loose or de- 
tachable parts liable to be tampered with or 
to be taken away. All working parts of the 
flushing mechanism of urinals and closets, 
except the push buttons, should be located 
in the utility corridors, accessible only to 
the attendants. Simplicity in action is the 
main requirement of all flushing devices. 
Hot water, while not absolutely necessary 
at the basins, is quite desirable to encourage 
the habit of washing the hands after use 
of the toilet conveniences. For the main- 

















456 


tenance of cleanliness in the stations hot 
water is necessary at the slop-sinks. 

Much study should be given to the heat- 
ing, ventilating and lighting of the stations. 
A heating system is essential for the com- 
fort of both visitors and of attendants, and 
also to prevent damage to the plumbing 
pipes and traps in very cold weather, 
though it is not necessary to provide the 
same amount of heat as for living rooms. 
Unheated comfort stations have been tried

or sidewalk lights and to artificial illumina- 
tion even in daytime. 


Care of Comfort Stations 
The thorough daily cleaning of the sta- 
tions, made necessary by the carelessness 
of many of its users, is an important duty 
relegated to the attendants, who should be 
trustworthy and diligent servants, selected 
for their position because of their fitness, 
and not on account of political affiliations.

and abandoned. Proper ventilation should 
likewise be provided in the design, and 
some artificial system is required, both in 
the underground stations as well as in those 
above ground, for the ordinary window 
ventilation in these is out of the question 
during a large part of the year in very 
cold climates. The lighting should be abun- 
dant both in daytime and at night, to do 
away with dark corners where dirt may 
otherwise accumulate. In this particular

advantage of the sunlight, while under- 
ground stations must have recourse to vault 


A neglected and ill-cleaned station is sure 
to fail in its purpose as a public utility. 

In the larger stations attendants should 
be on the constant lookout so that no loose 
or easily detached fittings are appropriated 
and that no loitering or defacing of walls 
takes place. To do this efficiently attend- 
ants should be given police powers, as is the 
case in office and bank buildings. Attend- 
ants should therefore be uniformed, white 
suits being the best. Attendants should be 
polite and attentive. Large stations, if 
kept open day and night, require at least 
two shifts of attendants, whereas in the 














“

case of the smaller urinal stations the clean- 
ing service can be performed by porters, 
who are given a number of stations tc 
look after daily. While the annual wages 
bill for attendants forms a heavy item in 
the cost of maintenance, the annual cost of 
repairs will be decreased thereby. 


Periodical Inspections 


The attendants’ work should be regulated 
and checked by the municipal department 
in charge of the stations. It should be one 
of the duties of the officials of this depart- 
ment to make periodical sanitary inspec- 
tions, during which the condition of the sta- 
tion entrances, the walls, the floors and the 
fixtures should be noted, also the absence 
or presence of odors, dirt and litter, the 
use of disinfectants, and kindred matters of 
detail. 

Particular attention should be paid to the 
statistics of the average daily number of 
users of the stations, and the fact ascer- 
tained whether there is an insufficient, or 


_ else any superfluous, equipment as to the 


number of fixtures installed. 

If the station includes revenue-bearing 
features, the amount derived from each of 
these should be carefully noted. 


~ Financial Considerations 


.The question whether it is preferable to 
build. and operate comfort stations under 
municipal ownership, or else to give the 
privilege, as has sometimes been suggested, 
to private concerns, may be dismissed by 
stating that unquestionably such public 
structures should be put up by the city. 
Another question, less easily answered, is 
whether a fee should or should not be 


_ charged for the use of the fixtures? In 


Europe the fee system is almost universal, 
whereas a free use appears to be demanded 
in the United States. But why? Would 
it not be better to have half-a-dozen sta- 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


457 


tions suitably distributed and to charge a 
minimum fee which would help in. their 
proper maintenance rather than have but 
one station and this a free one? 

We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that 
during past years the principle followed has 
been to build a few large and elaborate sta- 
tions rather than to erect a large number 
of smaller stations, nor can we overlook the 
fact that many of the stations built in cities 
like New York, Brooklyn and Washington, 
D. C., have been unnecessarily costly. Per- 
sonally I hold the view that this was a tre- 
mendous mistake, which was aggravated by 
the further fact that the cost of operation 
and maintenance became enormously high. 
Recent comparisons between European 
(chiefly English) and American stations 
point out the fact that the former show an 
annual net revenue, whereas the American 
stations are operated at a Why 
should this be so? 

I believe the principal explanation to be 
the fact that in both large and small com- 
fort stations in Europe a great deal of 
attention is paid to revenue-bearing fea- 
tures, such as pay compartments, bootblack, 
cigar and newspaper stands, parcel-check- 
ing depots, telephone booths and informa- 
tion bureaus, where directories, maps and 
city guides may be had. It goes without 
saying that the utilities mentioned should 
in no way interfere with the primary object 
of the station, but there is no reason what- 
ever why they cannot be included without 
thus interfering. 

In the question of maintenance the small- 
type stations again offer substantial advan- 
tages, for only a minimum of attendance is 
necessary, and one porter can quite well 
be required to take care of a number of 
stations. 

The above facts, borne out by experience, 
deserve to be taken into serious considera- 
tion wherever a city contemplates the in- 
troduction of comfort stations.

The Ottawa Hills Tract in Toledo 


By Leonidas Polk 


OTOR out along a certain paved 
M thoroughfare leading into the west- 
ern suburbs of Toledo, and, at a 

point not quite five miles distant from the 


central business district, this sign will give 


its message to you: 





OTTAWA HILLS 


Civic Undertaking Founded 

on a Patriotic Belief in To- 

ledo’s Present and Future 
Greatness 











The sign marks the beginning of a 1,280 
acre residential area which the E. H. Close 
Realty Company is developing for John 
North Willys, President of The W illys 
Overland Company. It conveys the spirit 
in which the tract is being moulded into a 
highly improved and rigidly restricted home 
park, a property that will take rank with 
Roland Park, in Baltimore; Country Club 
District, in Kansas City; Forest Hill Gar- 
dens, on Long Island, and Shaker Heights, 
in Cleveland, as an example of modern 
ideas in city planning. 

Ottawa Hills is all hill and valley land. 
It extends for three miles along the course 
of Ottawa River, a small but picturesque 
stream. A very handsome prospectus 
issued by the Close Company describes it as 
“a succession of little valleys, linked by a 
winding river.” The tract is heavily tim 
bered, many of its great groves of trees an- 
tedating Toledo itself. 

Throughout the property, the lowlands 
along the river, about 400 acres in all, have 
been dedicated to public purposes and will 
be equipped as parks, playgrounds, golf 
courses, athletic fields, etc. Plans call for 
the building of five lakes, the deepening of 
the river channel in places and the installa- 
tion of bathing and boating pavilions. An- 


other public feature of large interest is the 
civic center that is being built at the en- 
trance to the property. Here will be lo- 
cated the shops, stores, garages, water 
tower, public halls, churches, schools, etc. 
Restrictions prevent the encroachment of 
business on any other portion of Ottawa 
Hills. 

The tract is being improved in units. 
Plat One, consisting of 100 acres, was 
opened last August, although work of im-

are for a period of fifty years, at the end of 
which time they may be renewed for suc- 
cessive periods of twenty-five years by a 
majority vote of property owners. This 
makes the restrictions self-perpetuating. 
rhis provision has been upheld by court de- 
cision. 

Fifty per cent of the width of each house 
in relation to the size of the lot must be de- 
voted to open space. For the beautification 
of this, the company offers free plans on 
planting and the services of its landscape 
engineers and gardeners. A maintenance 
charge of 20 cents per hundred square 
feet is assessed against lot owners. This 
charge covers lighting, improving and 
maintaining streets, cutting grass and 
ciring for shrubberies within the bounda- 
ries of the streets, operating and maintain- 
ing storm water drains, collecting and dis 
posing of garbage, ashes and rubbish, clean- 
ing sidewalks of snow in winter, elimina 
tion of weed growth on vacant land, etc. 
The company will look after maintenance 
until such time as an association of resi- 
dents has been formed, when the association 
will take charge. 

Restrictions and regulaticns at Ottawa 
Hills have been very carefully worked out. 
In the development of the property many 
very interesting problems have been met. 
Space does not admit of a detailed handling 
of this phase, but the company will very 
gladly furnish information to any firm that 
is interested,

CIRCLE GAMES AT A PLAY FESTIVAL IN KALAMAZOO 

















May, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 463 


For on those school grounds play is no 
longer a hit-or-miss diversion, directed by 
some child leader or brutalized by some 
bully, and too often participated in only by 
those who have strength, energy, daring 
and assertiveness. 


How the Change Came 


The change has been a gradual one. 
Ten years ago, when Miss Ethel Rockwell 
took her position as supervisor of phys- 
ical training in the Kalamazoo schools, or- 
ganized recreation was in its pioneer stages 
—not only many parents, but some teachers, 
frowned at this intrusion upon the legiti- 
mate school program. But through the 
courage, ability and perseverance of Miss 
Rockwell and of Superintendent Hartwell, 
who introduced that innovation, opposition 
was reduced little by little. Under Miss 
Rockwell’s supervision the teachers di- 
rected the gymnastic drills, the marches, the 
rhythmic games which increasingly drew 
them away from the old established order 
of motionless silence in the schoolroom. 

For a year or two very little was done in 
the way of outdoor work. The supervisor 
thought it wise not to urge this strongly 
upon the teachers. But gradually, when 
spring brought to the children the call of 
outdoors, some of the teachers more or less 
reluctantly followed their charges to the 
playground. Those who did this began to 
feel one by one the pleasure of the chil- 
dren, their own relaxation and the in- 
creased value of the work. So the practice 
of outdoor playing became established. 
When the growth of the department made 
it possible to transfer the recreational work 
from the overburdened grade teachers to 
a corps of specialists in physical training, 
the children had grown used to the miracle 
of teachers at play. 

The first step toward this specializing of 
recreation came in 1909, four years after 
Miss Rockwell began her work. The older 
boys were not finding under the classroom 
teachers (mostly women) who directed 
their physical training the organized ath- 
letics that they needed and desired. So Mr. 
Lawrence Taylor was brought from the 
Fast to supervise the grammar and high 
school boys. Except for this change the 
old plan continued for two years more. 
Then, in 1911, a director of physical train- 
ing was appointed in the East Avenue 


School. This was followed by similar in- 
novations in other schools, until now the 
department includes six men and eleven 
women, all graduates of well-established 
trair ing schools, besides two or three others 
who give part of their time to the work. 


The School Program 


The chance to secure this development 
and the connection of the playground with 
the regular school work came through the 
gradual adjusting of the school forces to a 
modified form of the Gary plan. In the 
arrangement at Kalamazoo each pupil's 
program is about equally divided between 
the “regular” and the so-called “special” 
studies. The regular studies include the 
subjects of the ordinary school curriculum. 
In these one teacher has charge of two 
groups of pupils. The special studies in- 
clude music, art, literature, penmanship and 
physical training; the teachers with special 
preparation in these subjects take classes 
from several grades. In this way, without 
undue increase in cost, it has been possible 
to secure an unusual number of specially 
equipped instructors in physical training. 

One striking fact is that the addition of 
so large a force of physical instructors adds 
to the payroll of the public school only the 
salary of the two supervisors (and there is 
a state law which compels the employment 
of one such supervisor in all towns above 
10,000 population) and that of one or two 
other teachers devoted to high school ath- 
letics and gymnastics. In the grades the 
teachers of physical training replace on the 
average an equal number of teachers and 
supervisors, so that the only increase in 
expense is the slightly higher remunera- 
tion of physical training teachers. 

The children of the four lowest grades 
are required to devote two 30-minute pe- 
riods a day to recreation, those of the fifth 
and sixth grades one such period daily, the 
seventh, eighth and ninth grades two 45- 
minute periods weekly, while above the 
ninth grade physical training is optional. 
Pupils in these higher grades may choose 
weekly as part of their elective system two

The Spirit of the Play-

Nowhere did the vis- 
itor see signs that the 
children find irksome 
the guidance of the 
teachers or that their 
guidance dwarfs the 
initiative and organiz- 
ing power of the pu- 
pils. Rather there was 

spirit of harmony 
and a sense of com- 
plete ness in great con- 
trast to that of the old 


fashioned school yard

Here, as on other supervised playgrounds, 


has been noticed that the much-needed 


lessons in fairness progress more rapidly 
where there is a director to give the im- 
petus. In the early days of the system, the 
relay races were constantly marred by the 
impulsive undisciplined child who always 
started over the line a fraction of a second 
too soon. A word, a look, sometimes, and 
now the spirit of fairness prevails generally. 
On one ground visited two groups of girls 
were playing patch-ball, side by side. One 
group played quietly, evenly, fairly; the 
others were thrown 
frequently into disor- 
der by noisy disputes 
and bickering. The 
puzzle, “Which group 
has been playing long- 
est?” was easy to an 
swer. Among a team 
of high school girls on 
another ground a dis- 
cission arose. The

tion in an occasional athletic meet where 
fifty-yard dashes and dashes of all dimen- 
sions and shot-putting and jumps, both 
“broad” and “high,” and relay races and 
races of every description test the strength 
and courage and stimulate the ambition. 

The girls, usually ignored in all but the 
ornamental or practical relations of life, are 
not neglected here. One sees them every- 
where on the playgrounds playing the 
games the girls need most, the games that 
develop physical strength and a sense of 
fair play. One finds them on the program 
of public entertainments, learning the 
meaning of vigor, competition and team 
work—words which conservative people 
would reserve for their brothers. There 
are whispers, too, of hikes and picnics for 
the girls which must delight the hearts of 
all who are wholesome and active. 

Almost every year there is a play fes- 
tival where the laughter of little children, 
the beauty and rhythm of dancing and the 
happy earnestness of games and contests 
tell the story of the year’s accomplishment. 


Watching the Results 
One who watches the Kalamazoo children 
at play cannot fail to realize the splendid 
spirit that pervades all the groups and to 
feel that as a body they are “lifted up and 
strengthened.” It is not so easy to analyze 
the situation, and, passing from crowd to 
individual, to show how each one has 
gained through play. But out of the many 
the teachers recall, here and there, a child 
whose progress, though conspicuous, is 

typical rather than exceptional. 
There are children from the country, 
with its boasted space and freedom, who 





Vor. XIV, No. 5 


cannot cope with the girls and boys who 
have had the school training. This is, in 
fact, almost always the case. It is not a 
question merely of knowing the games or 
one of ease and self-confidence. Rather, 
they seem to be muscle-bound, and it is 
only after months of studied training that 
they can compete with the rest in strength 
or alertness. 

There was a very fat boy who, as if 
hopelessly unwieldy, stood about wistfully 
watching the others but would not take 
part himself. Finally, the teacher insisted 
that he should “go in and do things.” One 
by one he has mastered the feats of the 
other boys until he can do anything but 
“chin himself.” Another boy seemed to 
utterly lack nerve control. The other boys 
said, “You can’t play,” and tried to jostle 
him out of the games. But he stubbornly 
persisted, until now, though he is in the 
lowest section of the fifth grade, his record 
is the third among all the boys of the fifth 
and sixth grades. There was a girl of 
twelve, lame from infantile paralysis, who 
under the studied influence of her parents 
and her teachers, threw herself into the 
exertion of games and dances, so that she 
probably owes it in large measure to her 
physical training at school that she has now 
almost overcome her serious lameness, and 
as a college student can dance and play 
games, a normal, healthy young woman. 

These are all physical results. The 
growth of mind and spirit is a harder thing 
to test, and it takes time for that. But it 
is safe to prophesy that if the present sys- 
tem prevails, Kalamazoo will raise up a 
generation of parents better rounded in 
every respect than it has known before.

as that they present in readable form one

subject, the reader is referred to Mr. Fred- 
erick Law Olmsted’s “Introduction” to the 
volume in the National Municipal League 
series entitled “City Planning,” just pub- 
lished, or to his earlier “City Planning, an 
Introductory Address,” published by the

to know. 

These books, or a selection from them, 
should be in public libraries, where all may

Values Resulting from the Federation of Private 
Charities in Erie, Pa. 


By Guy T. Justis 
Executive Secretary, Erie Social Service Federation 


Erie for many years to raise their 

maintenance funds through campaigns. 
As long as there were but few charities, 
this plan was quite satisfactory. As the 
social consciousness grew, however, new 
needs and new social duties were discov- 
ered and new organizations sprung into 
being. 

There are in Erie to-day twelve well- 
organized philanthropic organizations, be- 
sides the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. 
While three of them have been in existence 
nearly forty years, half of them have been 
organized during the last eight years. 
With this number of organizations, the 
campaign method of raising funds had be- 
come burdensome and unsatisfactory. 

The need of a federation whereby the 
different charities might have one big cam- 
paign a year covering the needs of all the 
institutions, instead of eight or ten cam- 
paigns scattered throughout the year, early 
became apparent. The financial advantages 
alone appealed to the workers. In 1910 the 
first steps were taken to form such an or- 
ganization. Committees were appointed in 
the Board of Trade, in the Chamber of 
Commerce and in the Associated Charities 
to work out a plan. 

Progress was made slowly for the next 
four years. The older and well-organized 
philanthropies were afraid that a federa- 
tion would mean a sacrifice on their part 
to the advantage of the smaller organiza- 
tions. The smaller organizations were 
afraid that the Federation might not con- 
sider their work necessary and order it dis- 
continued. The plan was new and Erie has 
its share of persons who are content with 
present conditions and are afraid to blaze 
new trails. On the other hand, it was be- 
coming increasingly harder to raise the 
needed funds. The giving public had be- 
come confused by the constant and numer- 
ous appeals and were losing interest in the 
real social problems of the community. Or- 
ganizations were competing for public 
favor and support; codperation was becom- 


| haa peen the custom of the charities in 





ing more difficult; directors and many paid 
officials of the organizations were finding 
it necessary to give more and more of their 
time to the problem of paying the last 
month’s bills, and less and less of their time 
to the social work for which they were 
organized, 

The success of the Cleveland Federation 
for Charity and Philanthropy brought new 
hope, courage and enthusiasm to the work- 
ers in Erie. In the fall of 1914 the com- 
mittees representing the three organiza- 
tions named above decided the time oppor- 
tune to launch such an_ organization. 
Messrs. E. H. Mack and Robert Spittal, 
leading merchants as well as most generous 
givers, gave a dinner at the Lawrence 
Hotel. Representatives from all of the so- 
cial and charitable agencies of the city ac- 
cepted invitations to this dinner. A direc- 
tor from the Cleveland Federation was 
present and explained the success of the 
movement there. 

The Erie Social Service Federation was 
born at this meeting. A few weeks later 
all of the leading charities of the city had 
decided to unite with the Federation, a con- 
stitution was adopted and a Board of Di- 
rectors elected. A trained social worker 
was chosen Executive Secretary. 


Gifts and Givers—Before and After 

A survey of the givers to the federated 
organizations revealed this fact: that 
the psychological effect on the public of 
numerous appeals is for individuals to feel 
that they are contributing both often and 
much to charity. The truth of the matter is 
that they contribute to but few of the ap- 
peals and in very small amounts. Out of a 
population of 80,000, representing 16,000 
families, only 2,190 firms or individuals had 
contributed to any of the twelve organiza- 
tions. The contributions had amounted to 
$20,496, an average of less than $10. Of 
these 2,190 givers, 1,656, or 75.6 per cent, 
gave to only one of the twelve organiza- 
tions, showing that while the public were 
complaining of the numerous campaigns 











ss 











May, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 


and constant solicitation, they were not re- 
sponding. Only 198, or 9 per cent, of the 
givers gave to more than two organizations, 
and only two gave to eight of the twelve. 
As to the size of their aggregate gifts, 868, 
or 39.6 per cent, gave $1 or less; 1,554, or 
71 per cent, gave $5 or less, and only ten 
gave over $200. 

It was also found that the few generous 
givers of the community were contributing 
more than their share, and that the number 
of contributors was annually decreasing. 
Four per cent of the givers had contributed 
54 per cent of the funds, and Io per cent 
of the givers had contributed 75 per cent 
of the funds. It was found that the organi- 
zations were not being supported in accord- 
ance with the relative importance of the 
work they were doing. Some of the most 
important organizations were finding it 
more difficult to secure needed funds, while 
others less important but whose work was 
more spectacular were laying up a surplus 
annually. The public was not giving intel- 
ligently according to the merits of the dif- 
ferent activities, but rather according to 
the personal influences brought to bear. 

In preparing the general budget for the 
Federation, each organization was asked to 
present a financial statement showing in 
detail the receipts and expenditures for the 
last year’s work, also a budget of estimated 
expenses for the coming year. For most 
of the organizations this was a new expe- 
rience. 

The Board of Trustees decided that, con- 
sidering the local conditions, a financial 
campaign would be the best way of calling 
attention to the new organization and also 
to secure the combined budget. A cam- 
paign was put on at the beginning of the 
fiscal year, October 11-20. While Erie 
had been visited two months previously by 
a disastrous flood, for the relief of which 
citizens had contributed $55,000, pledges 
were secured during this campaign amount- 
ing to over $65,000, and much more has 
come in during the five months since the 
campaign. It is an increase of 200 per cent 
above what the federated organizations re- 
ceived from donations during the previous 
year, and an increase of 100 per cent above 
what they had received from donations and 
from fairs, balls and other benefits. 

The number of givers has been increased 
from 2,190 to 4,110, or nearly 100 per cent. 
One family in four is now contributing to 


469 


private charity. Some thought that be- 
cause the Federation promised not to solicit 
a person but once a year, many would take 
advantage and give in mucn_ smaller 
amounts than they had given under the old 
plan. Quite the opposite was the case. 
While the average gift under the old plan 
was less than $10, under the federated plan 
it was increased to nearly $17. The larger 
givers especially show a substantial in- 
crease under the federated plan, as shown 
by the following table:

Gains in Constructive Social Work 

Greater than the financial gains, however, 
have been the gains in constructive social 
work. Formerly Erie had two private re- 
lief-giving charities, the Catholic Loan and 
Aid Society and the Associated Charities. 
Under the Federation these two societies 
have been united in one, the Associated 
Charities, resulting in economy of both time 
and money and in greater efficiency of ser- 
vice rendered. 

The Social Service Exchange (called 
Confidential Exchange in many cities) has 
been established for the first time. The As- 
sociated Charities attempted to form one a 
few years ago, but because of jealousies ex- 
isting between the various organizations it 
had failed. Under the Federation the dif- 
ferent organizations feel that the Exchange 
belongs to one as much as to another, and 
all are codperating. Not only do the fed- 
erated organizations use the Exchange, but 
the Directors of the Poor, the Mothers’ 
Pension Board and other organizations 
have learned its value. 

The charities have been communalized. 
Formerly each charity had its group of 
admirers who were interested in it and in 
little else. Those interested in the hospi- 
tals saw little use for the Associated Chari- 
ties, or the different Homes, and vice versa. 
Under the federated plan the public seems 
to feel that all the charities are needed, that 
all are doing good work, that they belong to 
the community and should be supported in- 
telligently and adequately by the commun- 
ity. While the givers were given the privi- 
lege of designating to what organizations 
their gifts should be sent, only 10 per cent

so designated. The rest left it to the direc- 
tors of the Federation to be distributed 
where most needed. 

The cause of “cooperation” has been 
strengthened beyond measure. There is a 
spirit of fellowship and a “get-together” 
spirit existing among social workers and 
all interested in social work, such as we 
believe could never have been brought 
about under the old plan. This has just 
been put to a test during the National Baby 
Week. The social workers got togethe r al

conditions, the equal of which Mrs. Max

he standard of work done by the dif- 
ferent organizations has been raised to a 
higher plane. Conferences on better plans 
and methods are held regularly, which mean 
much for efficiency both in the organiza- 
tions themselves and in their cooperation. 

Eprtor’s Note.—A detailed outline of the method of 
organizing the Erie Social Service Federation has beer

Bringing the Prisons to the People 


RINGING the prisons to the people for 
inspection is the remarkable feat 
which the New York Prison Exhibit, 

now touring the state of New York in the 
interests of prison reform, comes near to 
accomplishing. What is left to the imagi- 
nation, after one has viewed this striking 
collection of motion pictures and still pic- 
tures, models and mechanical devices, all 
explained and interpreted briefly and in 
every-day language, is likely to be supplied 
through an awakened interest in knowing 
what happens to the local lawbreakers and 
what sort of chance they have to become 
good citizens. 





Che Joint Committee on Prison Reform, 
105 East Fortieth Street, New York City, 
is using the exhibit in a campaign to bring 
home to the average citizen the fact that 
prison reform concerns him immediately 
and vitally, since the welfare of citizens 
depends upon adequate protection against 
lawbreakers. 

The exhibit was first shown in the Rus- 
sell Sage Foundation Building, New York 
City. After it had been viewed by many 
thousands of people during its two weeks’ 
stay there, it went to Buffalo, Rochester, 
Syracuse and Albany. The plans for its 
further use include another longer period in

and honest way. I emphasize the word ‘hon- 
est,’ because a constant temptation in any ex- 
hibit is to make a sensational point with some- 
times too little regard for accuracy. Nowhere 
perhaps, more than in an exhibit, is it possible 
to dexterously overemphasize, or to under- 
state, or to give a slant to a panel (whereon 
are but few words, a fact that might offer a 
ready excuse in case of any challenge as to 
accuracy). Furthermore, exhibits have to 
some extent, perhaps, become regarded as 
places of strong statements. Yet our expe- 
rience in preparing the Prison Exhibit on thor- 


uughly accurate lines | 
the strongest thing that a panel 
present is the truth, simply presented, and 
with restraint.” 

Alexander Cleland, Secretary of the 
Joint Committee on Prison Reform, is 
charge of the campaign, which is already 
bringing gratifying results. His plan is to 
keep the facts of the exhibit up to date as 
far as possible, so that it will have a long 
period of usefulness.

Types of Apparatus and Rules for Their 
Use in Philadelphia Playgrounds 


CHOOL playground activities are out- 
lined in the Annual Report recently 
issued by the Board of Public Educa- 

tion of Philadelphia. The system of this 
city, which is under the direction of Wil- 
liam A. Stecher, Director of Physical Edu- 
cation of the Department of Superintend- 
ence, consists of 128 playgrounds located in 
three districts. Since the establishment of 
the first playgrounds (four in number) in 
1895, they have met with marked success, 
illustrated by a total attendance, for ten 
months in 1914-15, of 619,881. 

The experience in Philadelphia has 
shown the wisdom of adopting certain rules 
which, it has been found, children not only 
live up to, but see to it that others also 
obey. The following are some of the rules 
for the prevention of accidents and pre- 
serving the general moral tone of the play- 
ground : 

RULES FOR USING PLAYGROUND 
APPARATUS 

To prevent accidents, always look for the danger 
zone. (These are either lines painted on the ground, 
or ropes stretched near some dangerous places.) 

Swines—It is against the rules: 

1. To stand up on the seat to swing or to start 

the swing. 

For two children to occupy one seat 

3. To push and run under the swing, or to push 

by holding on to the feet of those who are 
swinging. 
Sliding Boards—It is against the rules: 
1. f, slide down in a standing position. 
2. To walk or crawl up the slide. 
Giant Stride—It is against the rules: 

1. To take a twist. 

2. To push anyone around. 

8. To tie the ropes together. ; a 
Baseball with a hard ball and a bat is positively 


rohibited. A light ball and bat may be used in very 
coe yards, if permission is granted by the office. 


9 


Smoking is positively pr ‘ 
Totlets—Children are f idde play game t t 
iround toilets. \ll persor ire warned ag t ter 


ing near or in the toilets 

Of further interest to those who desire 
to keep in touch with playground develop- 
ment are the recommendations as to play- 
ground equipment. Supervisor Philip G. 
Lewis, in his section of the report, advo- 
cates the following: a four-seat swing 
frame, giant stride, seesaw (two boards), 
sand bin, sliding board, a double horizontal 
bar, some balls, ring toss and rubber quoits. 
The cost of equipment of this character is 
approximately $200. Mr. Lewis notes fur- 
ther certain “Improvements in the Play 
Apparatus,” as follows: 

Swings—Iron rods have been equipped with 
cial “turn,” this acting as a locking device 
and at the ring on the cross beam 

Safety Zone Standards—These are iron | to 
support a rope stretched around any app: 
the children of danger 

Giant Stride—Filling the upright p 
to deaden the sound of the chain knockin

it the seat 


pipe is a great improvement. 

Sand Bin—The bin is now made collapsible. wit! 
malleable iron side and corner fittings Ihe bin can 
be put together and taken apart without any bolts 


screws or tools 

Basketball—The outer seam ball is reinforced 
a patch on that part of the ball where the n 
of the seams meet The result is that last 
used less balls than in the several seasons previo 

Indoor Basebails—This ball is now being made with 
the outer seam, also with a much heavier hide The 
outer seam enables the teacher to repair the ball in 
a much shorter time and with much less difficulty th 
formerly. This ball lasts much longer than the regu 
lar seam ball 

Repair Kit—The necessity of constantly repairing 
balls prompted the idea of a repair kit to contain 
following articles: Six 2%-inch round-point carpet 
needles; 6 yards of rawhide lacing, 3/16 inch; 2 
ounces beeswax; 1 tube rubber cement (smal! size); 
rubber, for patches for mending bladders; 100 yards 
of linen thread for sewing balls. Much money 
been saved by the introduction of this repair kit.

FACTORS IN THE SUCCESS OR

are:

As the manufacturers of the various types of pavement are vitally interested in the 
proper construction and maintenance of their products, and have necessarily made a very 
careful study of this subject, they are able to offer thoroughly practical advice regarding fac- 
tors to be considered and mistakes to be avoided. It is not the intention of this series of 
articles to advocate the merits of any particular kind or brand of pavement. The assump- 
tion is in each case that a city has decided to lay a pavement of the type under discussion; 
the object of each article being to offer suggestions as to how the longest life may be obtained 
for such a pavement at the least possible expenditure to the municipahty. 


The Bitulithic Pavement

HEN considering the subject of this 
W series of articles, viz., “Factors in 
the Success or Failure of Street 
Pavements,” one must at least take into 
account the following points, irrespective 
of the particular type of construction being 
studied: 
(a) Suitability of the “type” for the char- 
acter of the street in question 
(b) Design of each of the integral parts of 
the pavement: 
1. Subsoil drainage 
2. Foundation 
3. Wearing surface 


(c) Durability of the materials 

(d) Character of the workmanship to be 
expected 

(e) Maintenance 

(f) Interest of the contractor in character 
of his product 


Suitability 


In considering suitability, many points 
are of importance, among them climate, 
noiselessness, grade of street, and char- 
acter of traffic. A detailed discussion of 
these factors is hardly within the scope of 
the present article; the assumption being, as 
indicated by the editor’s announcement in 
italics above, that a city has already deter- 
mined upon Bitulithic as the type to be used, 
and that the present discussion covers the 
proper laying and maintenance of such 
pavement. It may perhaps not be out of 
place, however, to say in passing that the 
Bitulithic pavement is able to meet the 
widest range of climatic conditions, for, 
on account of the inherent stability of its 
mineral aggregate, the bitumen may be

made sufficiently soft to accommodate itself 
to the changes in temperature, and its great 
density and the use of the seal coat make it 
exceptionally resistant to the entrance of 
surface moisture. This pavement is in suc- 
cessful use in climates widely varying from 
the extreme heat of Phoenix and Tucson, 
\rizona, and El Centro, in the Imperial 
Valley of California, all near the Mexican 
border, to the humid climate of Portland, 
Oregon, and the extreme cold of Edmon- 
ton, Alberta. 

In considering contingencies of grade, 
the adaptability of Bitulithic is of no little 
importance; for its surface may be made 
comparatively smooth for Ievel residential 
streets or very rough for heavy grades, by 
merely changing the size of the maximum- 
sized stones in the mixture, and by varying 
the seal coat to meet the conditions. 


Design of Integral Parts 
1. SUBSOIL DRAINAGI 
It seems strange that, while this subject 
is acknowledged to be so important and re- 
ceives a prominent place in the discussions 
at conventions of engineers, it is nearly 
always one of the items least considered by 


ITHIC PAVEMENT 


an engineer when estimating the cost of 


improving a Street 


yr road and preparing 
plans and specifications therefor. 

\ll admit the absolute nec sSity Oo! keeping 
the subsoil dry, and most city specifications 
contain the well-known clause requiring 
that “all soft, springy places not affording 
a firm foundation shall be dug out and re- 
filled with suitable material,” ete. Chis 
sounds well, yet as a rule the excavation for 
the grade of the street is done during dry 
weather, when such places have been 
drained by nature and therefore are not 
re cognized and corrected; hence during the 
next protracted wet spell they are likely to 
become water-soaked and fail to support 
the foundation of the pavement. 

he only method of correcting this is 
for the resident engineer to investigate and 
watch the streets and roads during the wet 
spring months and definitely locate all such 
spots, when it is possible to do SO. he en- 
gineer should then decide upon the char 
acter and amount of drainage required, not 
only to include it in his estimate of cost 
when the improvements are to be made, but 
also to insist upon it, even though the local 
authorities may argue that the road is solid 














480 THE AMERICAN CITY 


and the extra cost of this drainage should 
be saved entirely, or the same amount of 
money be used in increasing the yardage 
of the paving. 


FOUNDATION 

\ll agree that an adequate foundation 
for a pavement is absolutely essential, but 
opinions are likely to vary greatly as to 
what is adequate for any given set of con- 
ditions, However, it is obvious that the 
foundation need not be so rigid for the 
same weight of traffic if the surface is 
dense and stable as if it is not. For this 
reason Bitulithic is an ideal material for 
resurfacing old macadam. Many miles of 
such work have been successfully laid, sav- 
ing the community the cost not only of a 
new concrete or other suitable base, but 
also the cost of removing enough of the 
old macadam to bring the surface to the 
desired grade. 

The view on this page shows a portion of 
Marlboro Street, Boston, Mass., laid in this 
manner. The old macadam was merely 
trued to an even contour by filling in the 
low spots with the coarse stone obtained 





Vor. XIV, No. 5 


from the high places. The street originally 
had granite block gutters 3 feet wide. 
hese blocks were desired by the city for 
use in repair work, so they were removed 
and the gutters brovght to grade with new 
crushed stone; but with this exception there 
were not 20 loads of new stone brought to 
the street, which totaled 16,443 square 
yards. The cost of regulating the grade in 
this manner, including the contractor's 
profit, was 15 cents per square yard, while 
removal of the macadam and substitution of 
a 6-inch concrete base would have cost ap- 
proximately $1 per square yard, and the 
extra expense ($14,000) would have added 
60 per cent to the cost of the work. 
Bitulithic has also been extensively used 
to resurface old wornout brick, concrete, 
granite and asphalt block pavements. In 
such cases the depressions are brought to 
grade with asphaltic binder, thoroughly 
compressed to give a uniform contour and 
then covered with Bitulithic surface mix- 
ture. It is essential, when resurfacing any 
form of block pavement, that the blocks be 
firmly set in their bed, and they should not 
be disturbed if this can be avoided. Where

it is necessary to disturb them in order to 
lower the grade, they should be reset on 
their sides and thoroughly grouted with 
Portland cement grout to ensure against 
“rocking” of the blocks under the strain of 
traffic. 

On this page is shown the bottom of 
a piece of Bitulithic cut from Eleventh 
Street, Wilmington, Del., in the presence

lhe thickness of either type of founda- 
tion naturally depends upon the character 
of the traffic and condition of the subsoil, 
and these should be intelligently considered 
by the engineer when drawing the specifica- 
tions. 

As a rule, on city streets, a 4-inch well- 
mixed concrete base is ample, except over 
old or new trenches, where greater thick- 
ness should be used; but as the area of 
these places cannot be definitely determined

to the laying of the 

Bitulithic. 

In cases where the street to be sur- 
faced has no macadam or other surface of 
suitable strength to be used as a foundation, 
of course a new base must be provided 
either by building a well-filled macadam or 
by laying a Portland cement or asphaltic 
concrete base, of whatever thickness may 
be required to sustain the traffic. If the 
subgrade has not been disturbed by trench- 
ing for underground service connections, 
the macadam is usually cheaper, and when 
properly built is ample if the subsoil is dry 
and properly drained. On the other hand, 
if the subsoil is weak, concrete should be 
used; also if any trenches have been dug, 
these should be carefully and properly re- 
filled, tamped and concreted, even if mac- 
adam base is used for the remaining area.

worn pavements as 
foundation for Bi- 
tulithic surface, as 
referred to above, is true conservation of 
resources. It will not only save large sums 
of money in actual construction, but will 
also enable the city to use the saving in 
resurfacing other pavements promptly and 
before they have become worn to such an 
extent that their usefulness, even as a foun- 
dation, has been utterly destroyed 
8. WEARING SURFACE MIXTURI 

The Bitulithic pavement was invented by 
the late Frederick John Warren in Igo!, in 
an effort to overcome the difficulties expe- 
rienced with macadam roads and the bitu- 
minous pavements then in use and to com- 
bine their advantages. His endeavor was 


to produce a wearing surface mixture com- 
bining, in the highest possible degree, the 
essential properties of density and inherent 
stability.

that shown in the

By reference to this 
photograph it will be seen 
that the maximum-sized 
stone has been used in suf- 
ficient quantity to form a 
framework, or skeleton, 
for the entire structure; 
and that the spaces be- 
tween these large stones 
are filled with successive- 
ly smaller-sized particles, 
used in such proportion as 
to form a compact aggre- 
gate, each particle of 
which is coated with the 
bituminous cement, which 
fills the few remaining 
voids in the aggregate and 
binds the various particles 
together into a_ dense, 
waterproof, stable mass 

Obviously, when design- 
ing a mixture of this type, 
it is absolutely essential 
to use the correct propor- 
tions of each of the va- 
rious sizes of mineral ag 
gregate in order to obtain 
a minimum of voids, or 
maximum density. If, for 
instance, too great a pro- 
portion of intermediate- 
sized stones is used, these 
will force the larger stones 
apart, leaving large voids 
to be filled with the fine 
mortar, thus not only in-

The seal coat consists of bituminous ce- 
ment and fine aggregate, all of which shall

either mixing these at the plant and rolling 
them in a very thin layer into the surface 
mixture on the street, or, after the surface 
mixture has been thoroughly rolled, it is 
painted with the bituminous cement and 
then covered with the fine chips, or aggre- 
gate, and again thoroughly rolled. This 
rolling is continued until no further com- 
pression can be obtained, when the pave- 
ment is allowed to cool and the street 
thrown open to traffic.

composition of the Bitulithic pavement are 
subjected to severe tests at one of the 
laboratories of the company before being 
approved for use. The stone supply is 
tested for absorption, abrasion, etc. The 
abrasion test is made by a method which 
is several times as severe as the Deval 
abrasion test used in most road material 
laboratories, and which is provided by the 
specifications of the American Society for 
Testing Materials. 

The Bitulithic cement is produced entire- 
ly under supervision of the laboratory 
force. Check samples are sent to the labo- 
ratory prior to shipment of the material to 
the various paving plants. The cement is 
tested not only for penetration, ductility, 
solubility in carbon bisulphide, carbon tet- 
rachloride, etce., as usually specified for 
asphalt cements in other types of construc- 
tion, but also by special methods for cement- 
ing strength and brittle point. 

The sand and filler (if the latter is 
needed, though usually found in sufficient 
amount in the crusher screenings) are also 
tested for grading and impurities. The re- 
quired grading of the sand depends upon 
the screen test of the crusher screenings, 
and very frequently no one sand can be 
found locally which will supply just the 
sizes which are missing in the screenings. 
In this case two sands, one coarse and one 
fine, must be used, and are insisted upon 
by the traveling inspector who visits the 
paving plant at the start of the contract. 

It has always been a rule of the company 
that neither its own construction depart- 
ment nor any of its licensees shall use any 


material which has not been approved by 
Warren Brothers Company's laboratory. 


W orkmanship 

Realizing fully that the time, effort and 
money spent upon designing would be all 
in vain, and failure sure to result, unless the 
workmanship at plant and street were ef- 
ficient in carrying out this design, the com- 
pany has spared neither effort nor expense 
to obtain competent, efficient construction 
men and to provide them with equipment 
which will enable them to mix and lay the 
pavement properly. 

In order to be sure that theory is carried 
into practice, daily samples of the mixture 
produced at each plant and the bitumen 
used in same must be sent to an efficient 
laboratory. 

These samples of mixture are extracted 
in a specially designed centrifugal machine; 
the analysis is compared with the mixture 
which had been proposed for that particu- 
lar street; and a report is mailed immedi- 
ately to the local superintendent with com- 
ments as to any variations found. If for 
any reason the variations are at all serious, 
the report is sent by telegraph, and the 
traveling inspector for that district is in- 
structed by telegraph to visit the city at 
once, investigate and correct the trouble, 
removing if necessary any defective mate- 
rial which may have been laid in the in- 
terim. 

Each plant force keeps a careful daily 
record of temperatures of all the ingre- 
dients, one copy being kept for the super- 
intendent and the other accompanying the 
sample to the laboratory. At the time the 
contract is started, the traveling inspector 
instructs the superintendent as to the num- 
her of square yards which may be obtained 
per batch of mixture. This “allowable 
yield” is based upon the specific gravity of 
the mineral aggregate and upon the rough- 
ness or smoothness of the foundation, and 
the “allowable yield” is set for an average 
thickness of more than 2 inches, so as to 
insure a minimum thickness of 2 inches 
after ultimate compression, even over the 
high spots in the foundation. The daily 
yield is also reported to the laboratory, and 
the construction forces are held strictly to 
account on this very important point. 

This question of thickness is one of the 
most important points to be observed in 
any sheet bituminous pavement. If it is 


























484 THE AMERICAN CITY 


too thin it will soon break and ravel, while 
if laid much over 2 inches thick it will not 
receive ultimate compression even under 
careful rolling. As a result it will be por- 
ous and will soon soak water—and the end 
is then in sight. 

Thorough compression is absolutely es- 
sential, for it is obvious that it is folly to 
design a mixture capable of being com- 
pressed so that the spaces between the par- 
ticles of aggregate are but 10 to 12 per cent 
of its volume, unless such compression is 
given as will accomplish that end. 


LICENSE MIXTURE AGREEMENT 


In order to provide the competition gen- 
erally required by law, and at the same 
time ensure the high quality of workman- 
ship which is believed to be necessary to 
success with any form of construction, a 
“License Mixture Agreement” is filed with 
the municipality. Under this agreement 
Warren Brothers Company agrees to in- 
stall a paving plant within a given distance 
of the street to be paved and there produce 
the Bitulithic mixture, which is delivered 
hot to the wagons of any responsible con- 
tractor, including the seal coat bitumen 
and aggregate, at a stated price per square 
yard; the agreement carrying with it the 
license to the contractor to use all of the 
patents which may be required for laying 
the pavement. 

We believe that this agreement serves 
the city in a twofold manner: 

1. It enables any responsible road con- 
tractor equipped with the usual rollers, 
wheelbarrows, teams and small tools used 
on macadam or similar work to bid for 
Bitulithic pavement, he purchasing the sur- 
face mixture from the responsible expe- 
rienced manufacturer just as he purchases 
brick, granite blocks, wood blocks, etc., 
from the expert manufacturer of these sur- 
face materials. 

Our price for the mixture is publicly 
stated and is the same to all bidders. This 
provides far broader competition among 
contractors than is obtained, for instance, 
in asking for bids upon so-called asphaltic 
concrete, as in that case the bidders are 
confined to those who own or are willing 
to rent or purchase paving plants. 

2. The manufacturer of the Bitulithic 
mixture naturally watches the-street work, 
advising with and helping the contractor 
most efficiently in every way possible, thus 


Vor. XIV, No. 5 


assisting the city engineer's force in ob- 
taining the most efficient workmanship. 


Maintenance 

When the street surface is cut to make 
underground service connections, not only 
should the trenches be carefully back-filled, 
but they should also be concreted, irrespec- 
tive of the character of the foundation of 
the remainder of the street, the concrete 
extending sufficiently beyond all sides of the 
actual trench to obtain a solid bearing on 
the subgrade. 

New surface mixture should then be laid 
in the usual manner. In cities where no 
Bitulithic plant is maintained permanently, 
the Bitulithic paving mixture can be 
shipped from the nearest available plant 
and readily reheated and laid by the city 
forces. It is wise in such cases for the city 
to require that the party making the cut 
in the street shall, after back-filling, pave 
the cut temporarily with wood blocks 
(which need not be even creosoted), so as 
to protect the pavement at edges of the cut 
until it is convenient to relay with Bitu- 
lithic. 

It sometimes happens that, after the 
pavement has been laid for some time, the 
trolley track must be raised an inch or so 
above the original grade, or the grade of 
an intersecting street is raised. Ordinarily 
this would mean relaying the pavement, but 
if the surface is Bitulithic the grade may 
be raised by cleaning and painting the old 
surface and then laying a fine Bitulithic 
mixture over the desired area. This “skim 
patch,” as it is called, may be feathered 
out to % inch thick, if necessary, and can 
be very cheaply and quickly applied. 

Naturally, Bitulithic will wear under the 
abrasion of traffic, but its life can be al- 
most indefinitely and very economically pro- 
longed by re-flush-coating it, say every third 
or fourth year after the expiration of the 
guarantee period. 

The company has been experimenting on 
this treatment for a number of years and 
owns patents for the method which has 
given the best results, viz.: After thorough- 
ly cleaning the old surface, paint it with a 
very thin coat of a bituminous cement 
softened with a temporary liquefier, which 
penetrates the bitumen in the old pavement 
and obtains an excellent bond thereto. 
After the liquefier has evaporated, hot bitu- 
minous cement is spread with a bitumen- 

















May, 1916 THE 
spreading machine over the first coat, while 
it is still fresh and clean; and then the sur- 
face is covered with coarse concrete sand 
and rolled, so as to force the sand into the 
cement. 

This method “enlivens” the bitumen in 
the old pavement, seals the surface anew, 
and is an exceedingly cheap means of 
maintenance. The company supplies the 
two cements specially prepared for this 
purpose, and will gladly furnish a repre- 
sentative gratis to assist the city forces in 
properly doing the work. 


Interest in Character of Product 
In the last analysis, this is the crux of 
the situation, as it may be taken as almost 
axiomatic that the character of the product 


AMERICAN CITY 


485 


is largely dependent upon the interest of 
the contractor in it. 

No one can have as great an interest in 
success as a responsible organization whose 
very existence depends upon that success. 
Hence, Warren Brothers Company main- 
tains that it is to the best interests of the 
municipality that the manufacture of the 
surface materials shall be by such an or- 
anization, especially when that manufac- 
ture necessitates the employment of skill, 
experience and scientific accuracy. 

For instance, no one would think of per- 
mitting a contractor to manufacture his 
own paving brick from local clay baked in 
a lime kiln. So the Bitulithic surface mix- 
ture should be manufactured by those who 
are most interested and have the greatest 
experience in such manufacture.

Common Sense and Esthetic Appreciation as 
Assets for the Municipal Engineer 
By E. A. Kingsley 


City Paving Engineer, San Antonio, Tex. 


HE majority of civil engineers are 
T not educated particularly along the 
lines of municipal engineering. 
Civil engineering is one of the applied sci- 
ences and is divided into a number of 
branches. Each separate branch is a spe- 
cialty, and to become an adept in any 
of these one must take up special study 
along that line. To be a success, the mu- 
nicipal engineer must specialize along muni- 
cipal lines, even going further by special- 
izing in paving and general municipal 
building or in sewer and water construc- 
tion. 

Not only is civil engineering an applied 
science, but in most of its branches an ex- 
act science. The railroad engineer is given 
the tonnage to be handled and he must 
build the road so that the maximum load 
can be hauled at the least possible cost. 
Curves are laid to a given formula and 
hills are cut to the maximum grades al- 
lowed. These limits are absolute and can- 
not be changed. 

The bridge engineer takes the profile of 
the location to be bridged; he is given the 
load to carry, and the bridge is first built 
on paper in the drafting room, each rivet 
and member being accurately shown on the 


plan. The bridge is then actually built, 
every part complete in the shop and each 
part marked and lettered to correspond to 
the shop drawing or plan. In the field the 
abutments and piers are built to carry the 
designed structure, and upon these is then 
erected the bridge, having been forwarded 
from the shop, perhaps hundreds of miles 
away. In all of this work accuracy must 
govern every movement; accuracy in design 
and construction, to the minutest detail, is 
essential. It is not a question of give-and- 
take nor an opportunity for the use of 
judgment. Rigid rules and formule are 
given for the methods, and the results are 
definitely determined, even to the smallest 
fraction. | Mathematical 
govern. 

Municipal engineering—especially paving 
design and construction—differs from the 
other branches of the profession in that 
exactness is not the governing tenet. To 
look at the maps of most of our cities one 
would be led to believe that not only had 
accuracy, but engineering, been forgotten 
altogether. The municipal engineer, how- 
ever, cannot be criticised for the layout 
plans of most American cities. Land-grab- 
bers and real estate boomers have platted

property to give the greatest number of 
lots with the least space for streets. Adja- 
cent property already platted is of no con- 
cern. The demands of the future and the 
possibilities for beautifying the property 
are never in a _ single instance given 
thought. The result is haphazard streets 
of various widths, without regard to con- 
venience, topography or the natural fitness 
of things. This condition makes the muni- 
cipal engineer’s work doubly difficult in 
after years.

WITHOUT REGARD TO LINES 


Again, until within the last few years 
municipal engineers, with but few excep- 
tions, were ex-railroad engineers. Their 
training had been altogether along the lines 
laid down for the railroad engineer. Re- 
cently there has come a change. Such ad- 
vocates as THE AMERICAN City are grad- 
ually educating the public to demand a 
change in municipal engineering practice 
and in the qualifications of the engineer. To 
the qualifications of technical education and 
experience are added the use of common

sense and the application of the esthetic. 
In other words, a successful municipal en- 
gineer cannot be used like a slide rule. 
Cities cannot be built nor streets laid out 
by certain set rules or formule. The engi- 
neer must learn first the lesson that while 
cities are to be built, or rather rebuilt, along 
lines as planned, the plans are merely 
guides to be followed. 

The railroad engineer has two points be- 
tween which to run a tangent. He has a 
maximum grade and must not go above that 
grade. His table gives him the costs al- 
lowed, and hills are cut and the hollows

filled to meet his lines. The municipal en- 
gineer has no rule or table he can follow. 
There is a street intersection every 350 feet, 
and some of the streets are well graded. 
Sidewalks in many places have already been 
constructed at considerable cost. On one 
side of the street the property levels are 
lower than on the other side. A splendid 
building costing thousands of dollars has 
been constructed on one corner, and _ its 
grade must be met. A permanent bridge 
has been built and cannot be done away 
with. Hundreds of other things must be 
taken into consideration—and ofttimes poli- 
tics. A straight grade would many times be 
very pretty, but absolutely impossible. Such 
work requires the exercise at all times of 
more common sense and good judgment 
than instrumental skill; in fact, it might be 


said that municipal engineering is seventy- 
five per cent common sense and good judg- 
ment and the rest technical knowledge. 
The technical knowledge is an absolute 
necessity and not to be passed over lightly, 
but without an abundance of good judg- 
ment there will be no successful 
engineer, 

To many it may seem out of place to 
apply the esthetic to street paving, but en-

gineers afe rapidly coming to realize that 
this principle is one of the actual neces- 
sities. Civil engineers have so long thought 
of their profession as one of right lines

and correct angles that the beauty in any 
branch of the work has been forgotten. It 
has not seemed possible that any beauties 
were there, and that surely street paving 
could have nothing bordering on the esthetic 
in its construction. Curbing and foundation 
are but structures of concrete, and cer- 
tainly a brick, a granite block, or a mac- 
adam surface could display no points of 
beauty. The engineer's duty is to lay out 
his lines and then to watch the construc- 
tion. He is employed to specify and then 
see that the specifications are carried out; 
the property owners depend upon his in- 
spection to secure good work. When the 
work is done, all that remains whereby the 
public may judge is the newly built street. 
By the appearance of the surface work 
must the entire work be judged for all time.

Street Lighting on a Cost-of-Service Basis’ 


By G. W. Van Derzee 


Assistant to the Vice-President of the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Company 


HERE are certain fundamental prin- 
ciples of rate-making and a form of 
street-lighting contract which will 

materially improve the conditions of street 
lighting problems. The contract proposed 
is designed to provide street-lighting ser- 
vice on a cost-of-service basis to the muni- 
cipality, in consideration of a guarantee by 
the municipality against financial loss to the 
utility. From a close analysis of its advan 
tages as compared with those of the term 
contract, the following conclusions may be 
drawn: 


1. The rates per lamp-year under a “cost-of 
service” contract will average 10 per cent lower 
than those that can be offered under a ten 


vear contract, and 20 per cent lower than thos« 
under a five-year contract 

2. The utility is guaranteed the integrity of 
its special street-lighting investment, and, 
therefore, is able to offer the municipality 
street-lighting rates at actual cost 


t 


3. The rates include only normal allowances 
for depreciation and no amortization of special 


equipment made necessary in a term contract 

4. The municipalities will profit year by vear 
in any economies practiced by the utility, duc 
to the annual adjustment of direct operating 
expenses 

5. As the number of lamps in the muni 
pality increases, the tendency is for the avert 
age spacing to decrease, which will lower th 
average special investment per lamp and de 
crease the element of fixed charges on the s1 
cial street lighting investment 

6. No limiting conditions of spacing of new 
lamps from nearest existing lamps need to be 
imposed in the contract, as the municipality 
has the privilege of specifying lamps at any

sponsibility 


The utility is vitally interested in the 


prosperity of the municipality. Decreased 
rates, under the “cost-of-service” contract, 
eventually mean more lamps. More lamps 


mean a better lighted and advertised muni 
cipality, which, in turn, ultimately means 
more business for the utility. The time has 
come for better mutual relations between 
the municipality and the utility The util 
ity should share in the support and encour- 
agement given by the municipality to its 
industries. In turn, the utility should shar« 
with the municipality the results of any in- 
creased economy which it is able to effect 
n the service it renders the municipality. 

The adoption of the “cost-of-service” 
contract opens the way for an important 
step in that direction

streets pleasanter to live on. Still people 
grumbled about the expense until it was 
discovered that the well-lighted streets were 
not only safer from accident and pleasanter, 
but also robbery, street rows, mischievous 
destruction of property and crime of all 


sorts become very much less common. Just

lights burning all night in a store or bank 
than to employ bolts, shutters and watch- 
men, and that lights protected property 
from burglars and petty thieves much more 
effectively, so it was found that the good 
lighting of a district greatly lessened crime, 
especially when extended to the city streets 
and alleys. It is said that ten street lamps 
equal one policeman for the protection of 
property and the prevention of disorder. 
Well-lighted streets were also found to be 
a protection to health in several different 
ways, some of them quite unexpected. 
Light put a stop to the unsanitary practice 
of throwing garbage, waste material, broken 
crockery, ashes, dead cats and other refuse 
into the streets under cover of darkness. 
Even after it had come to be considered 
bad form to throw waste and rubbish out 


Vor. XIV, No. 5 


in front of your own house, it still remained 
a common habit to carry them to the back 
of the lot or around the corner into the 
nearest dark side street or alley and there 
dispose of them. 

Another way in which plenty of street 
light protected health was by encouraging 
people to leave their windows open at night. 
Although part of the old dislike of leaving 
windows open after dark was the fear of 
drafts and cold, a considerable part of it 
was the dread of burglars. In addition to 
this, lighting of all sorts is an enemy of 
disease germs and decay, for, as we have 
already seen, a natural antagonism exists 
between light and dirt. No street or room 
which is not well lighted has a chance of 
being kept decently clean. 





Training Students for New York Municipal 
Service 


The findings of the committee appointed 
by President Mezes, of the College of the 
City of New York, to report on the oppor- 
tunities and obligations of the College in 
the matter of training students for entrance 
to the public service and improving the ef- 
ficiency of those already in the service are 
published in a recent issue of the bulletin 
of the New York Bureau of Municipal Re- 
search. The report, which was prepared 
for the committee by Prof. Frederick E. 
Breithut, contains an introductory article 
by Prof. Charles A. Beard, Supervisor of 
the Training School for Public Service of 
the New York Bureau of Municipal Re- 
search, 

Ten tables, embodying the data gathered 
by the Municipal Service Survey Commit- 
tee, show the number of employes under 
each title in each city department, the voca- 
tional grouping of the positions, number of 
employes in each group, some salaries paid, 
civil service appointments, probable civil 
service examinations, and the exempt posi- 
tions. The committee particularly recom- 
mends that there be appointed a Director 


of Public Service Training at the College. 


whose duty shall be to keep a record of all 
municipal positions open to college stu- 
dents and the subjects and dates of ap- 
proaching examinations, and, further, that 


a standing committee be appointed to co- 
operate and advise with the Director. 
Professor Beard, in the summary to his 
introductory article, entitled “The Problem 
of Training for Public Service,” points out 
that certain changes are necessary if the 
public service is to be recruited according 
to the most approved standards of the pres- 
ent time. These changes are as follows: 


1. The civil service commission must become 
a training board as well as an examining 
board, 

2. The ordinary academic tests which are 
now applied to persons actually entering the 
public service should be applied to persons 
who wish to prepare for that service by taking 
the required apprenticeship course under the 
direction of the city. 

3. Inasmuch as New York City has a well- 
equipped college of its own, nothing seems 
more logical than that the city enter into co- 
operation with the College of the City of New 
York, and through that institution with other 
colleges and universities in the city. An agree- 
ment might readily be made whereby those 
properly qualified students who have passed the 
preliminary entrance examinations should serve 
their apprenticeship in city departments with 
the respective departmental officers under the 
supervision of the appropriate officers of the 
City College. As an inducement to encourage 
young men to seek the public service, the City 
College and other institutions of learning in 
the city might grant credit toward the aca- 
demic degrees for units of work thus per- 
formed under adequate supervision.

laid, as is now hoped, during the latter part 
of the celebration. 

The importance of Newark in the state 
and in the country, it is thought by many, 
has been somewhat overshadowed by the 
city of New York, which is so near us, but 
this celebration will do more than anything 
that has been done in the past to place 
Newark where she belongs in the eyes of 
the people of this country. Newark is the 
eleventh city in the United States in point 
of manufactures. There are within her 
borders 2,200 factories in which 252 dif- 


ferent varieties of goods are manufactured, 
of an annual value of $259,000,000. 

The people of all classes—men, women 
and children—have felt the stir of this 
great civic enterprise. Enthusiasm for its 
success and activity in bringing that success 
about may be found alike in the shop, the 
store, the factory, the church, the school 
and the city government. The prominent 
citizens have been especially active in mak- 
ing this one of the greatest of municipal 
celebrations, not only commercially, but

also in a more spiritual sense, and in com- 
bining the material life of the community 
with the intellectual in such a way as to 
give rise to the term “The Newark Idea.” 

One of the important opening events will 
be the largest music festival that has been 
held anywhere in the East in recent years. 
Thousands of singers from three of New 
Jersey's largest cities, members of festival 
societies, will appear for six magnificent 
performances, from the opening day, May 
i to May 4. Large prize money and the 
excellent management of the Newark Mu- 
sic Festival Association have resulted in 
creating new music of great beauty. Band 
and orchestra will be massed together with 
an imposing list of selections by vocal 
artists of the Metropolitan Opera Company 
of New York. 

Dates have been already fixed and an- 
nounced for fifty public events. Especially 
noteworthy will be the Newark Industrial 
Exposition from May 13 to June 3, which 
is to be opened by President Woodrow Wil- 
son and which will bring forcibly to the 
attention of the country the variety and 
character of Newark’s manufactures. 

On the nights of May 30, 31 and June | 
and 2 there will be a splendid historic page- 
ant in Weequahic Park, one of the most 
beautiful of city parks. The pageant will 
cost about $60,000 and will involve the dra- 
matic services of 3,500 persons. It is esti- 
mated that 50,000 people will view each 
performance. Half of the seats and all 
standing room will be free. This pageant, 
which has been written by Mr. Thomas 
Wood Stevens, the eminent dramatist, must 
have the effect of giving a romantic touch 
to the city, which those who see the pageant, 
both old and young, will carry with them 
for the rest of their lives. 

Athletic events of national importance 
will be provided at a cost of $40,000. In 
the various events which are to continue 
throughout the celebration in the course of 
the five months, there are to be many 
parades, conventions, special ceremonies, 
sports, tournaments, concerts, religious 
mass meetings, theatricals, automobile gym- 
khana, and contests, military exercises, 
charitable surveys and school exhibits. 

An interesting feature of the celebration 
has been the famous poster contest, result- 
ing in the creation of a splendid series of 
art posters, of which THe American City

has already published reproductions of the 
prize-winning designs. 

We have faith that this great celebration 
will place Newark before the people of this 
country in her true light; that it will 
awaken within her citizens a nobler public 
spirit; and that it will tend to create a civic 
genius which will send her forth in tke 
splendid years to be with new aspirations, 
new ideals, new hopes and a new spirit of 
civic devotion and loyalty.

Applying the Lessons of a 
Conflagration 
Paris, Texas—The readers of Tue 


AmerICAN City will not be interested in 
any merely graphic description of the great 
fire at Paris, photographs of which were 
reproduced in the April number. It would, 
however, be very difficult to conceive of an 
hour more awful or a scene more weird. 
The wind was blowing a gale of probably 
45 miles per hour from the southwest. A 
trash pile burning near the southwestern 
portion of the city ignited a warehouse. 
The alarm was turned in and promptly re- 
sponded to, but notwithstanding the efforts 
of an efficient paid fire department, well 
equipped, there was not one moment when 
there was even a substantial hope that the 
fire demon would be brought to bay. 

The section in which the conflagration 
started was flanked to the northeast by a 
section thickly settled with wooden, shingle- 
covered residences, all of which were as dry 
as tinder. The destroying element fairly 
leaped from house to house in an onward 
fan-shaped movement. Many houses were 
ignited as much as a quarter of a mile 
ahead of the main devouring line. Soon 
the commercial district was reached, in 
which the buildings were covered with non- 
combustible roofing material, and _ built 
of brick, stone and cement. For a brief 
period it was thought that the confla- 
gration might be stayed here, but it quick- 
ly veered to the right and continued 
its devastation among residences, and then 
also leaped clear over all the business dis- 
trict to houses a full quarter of a mile 
away; thus the conflagration was raging on 
three sides of the commercial section. 

The heat became so intense that flames 
burst out from scores of wooden windows 
and doors almost simultaneously in num- 


AMERICAN 


City 493 


bers of places. Thereupon the scene beg- 
gared all description and became a holo- 
caust. The falling walls, numerous explo- 
sions, the cries of distressed people, the 
downpour of sparks as numerous as hail- 
stones, the howling, raging winds, made 
altogether a scene never to be forgotten by 
those able to observe it in a frame of mind 
sufficiently calm to appreciate its awfulness. 
It was here that dynamite was called into 
requisition with a hope of staying the tide 
of destruction. Eight or ten buildings were 
shattered to pieces, but to no purpose; it 
rather appeared to furnish additional and 
even more inviting fuel. The 
ered became so extensive that notwithstand- 
ing the fire departments of Dallas, Bonham, 
Hugo and Cooper—some coming by special 
train, others under their own motor power 
—it could not be successfully combated. 
The burned area—covering 264 acres—ex- 
tended from the southwest corner of the 
city through to the northeast, stopping only 
when it reached an old field beyond the city 
limits where there was no more fuel. 

The total loss reaches into the millions 
probably between eight and ten, though 
many place the figures higher. Nine-tenths 
of all mercantile establishments, including 
wholesale as well as retail stores, were 
ruined. Of 1,440 buildings destroyed, 1,051 
had combustible roofs, or 73 per cent of the 
total number. Insurance adjustments are 
proceeding as expeditiously as possible, but 
have not reached a stage which will enable 
one to give anything like an accurate esti- 
mate of the total loss which will be reached. 

Immediately after the fire the City Coun- 
cil met and passed an ordinance which for- 
bids the use of wood shingles for roofing 
material on any structures hereafter to be 
erected, and permits old roofs to be repaired 
only to the extent of twenty-five per cent. 
Six years ago just such an ordinance was 
passed, but the people generally complained 
so loudly, persistently and bitterly that the 
Council found themselves confronted with 
the predicament of either repealing the or- 
dinance or leaving town, because life was 
intolerable at home among their 


areca COV 


constit- 


uents. It is needless to say it was repealed, 
and the penalty—a heavier, galling, burden- 
some one—is now being paid. 

Perhaps no fire anywhere has ever more 
strikingly demonstrated the danger which 
must always attend the use of the wood 
shingle. 


In sections of the town where

residences were not so congested as to 
ignite by intense heat at close proximity, 
there are standing here and there lone 
houses covered with non-combustible roofs 
upon which the shower of falling sparks 
had no effect, while every house in all direc- 
tions from these was entirely consumed. 
Of the opportunities which this disaster 
brings, I will not write at this time. The 
spirit of our people is great. A more opti- 
mistic citizenship would be hard to find. 
Our feet are in the ashes, but above the 
dust, smoke and grime we have already 
caught a vision of a new city which is ap- 
proaching; one with wider streets, new 
building lines, harmonious architecture, 
zones appointed for commerce and indus- 
tries, plazas and playgrounds, civic centers 
and the grouping of public and semi-public 
buildings. All these and much more are 
now being provided under the direction of 
an expert in city planning and landscape 
architecture. ED. H

Council-Manager Government at 


Niagara Falls 

NraGarA Faris, N. Y.—On January 1, 
1916, the federal plan of municipal govern- 
ment in Niagara Falls was succeeded by the 
council-manager form according to Plan 
“C.” New York legislative enactment, 1914. 

There were three factors arguing for the 
success of the new form. The majority of 
the people were heartily in favor of the 
plan. They had endorsed it at the polls and 
they had endowed it with the second instru- 
ment necessary for accomplishment—they 
had selected a splendid Council. Lastly, the 
press expressed itself as heartily in sym- 
pathy with the real interests of the city. 

However, there were two disturbing fea- 
tures which entered into the situation very 
soon after the new government went into 
force. The Attorney-General handed down 
a decision which questioned the constitu- 
tionality of certain portions of Plan “C.” 
Also, at the time of assuming control, the 
administration, with a view solely to the 
betterment of the service, had appointed of- 
ficials to take the place of those appointed 
by the previous administration under civil 
service. 


AMERICAN CITY 


VoL. XIV, No. 5 





In this connection a curious complication 
arose. It was found that the civil service 
laws of the state of New York especially 
provided for the protection and retention in 
office of volunteer firemen and veterans. It 
so happened that some of the former em- 
ployes belonged to these preferred classes. 
The city became at once involved in suits 
instituted by the deposed men. The Court 
ordered the restoration of office to those 
who came directly under the provisions of 
the law. 

The trouble with deposed employes was 
capable of gradual adjustment, but the situ- 
ation with regard to the legal status of the 
city government was more distressing. Two 
methods of solution offered themselves. 
Either a case could be brought into court 
to test the legality of Plan “C,” or a char- 
ter could be submitted to the Legislature. 
The latter plan was selected as offering the 
easiest and quickest solution. At the pres- 
ent time the charter of the city has been 
passed by the Legislature, has had its public 
hearing and now awaits the Governor's 
signature. 

The idea of the unconstitutionality of 
the plan, and the experience of the city 
with the court in the cases of the deposed 
employes, gave the political opponents of 
the system a much-desired opportunity to 
helittle and criticise the administration. We 
believe that even this condition has been 
productive of good. We know our friends 
and we know whom we have to convince. 

Nearly four months of council-manager 
government have passed. It is safe to 
prophesy that our worst period is over. 
After all, the troubles which attended the 
installation of the system have tested most 
thoroughly the organization. In certain 
other cities the members of the Council 
have allowed personalities to creep into 
their deliberations until the purpose for 
which they were elected has become dim. 
The members of our Council have stood 
shoulder to shoulder. They have acted as 
one man, and, moreover, each member has 
individually supported the official acts of 
the legislative body. They have stood be- 
hind the manager, too, and have been ready 
to aid in every way. 

The people have had an understanding 
patience. They have not demanded spec- 


tacular reforms, but have been willing to 
wait upon a careful organization of the city 
forces.

May, 1916 THE AMERICAN CITY 495 


Four months is a very short time in a mu- 
nicipal span of life; hardly time for the 
general survey of conditions. Nevertheless, 
Niagara Falls is able to chronicle the fol- 
lowing results: 

A complete modern accounting system has 
been installed. 

Inspection of food and milk has been pro- 
vided for. 

The salary of officials under the new system 
is $3,500 less than formerly. 

A purchasing department is in full operation. 

The water and street departments have been 
consolidated under the Department of Public 
Service. 

While we have had the greatest snowfall in 
years, our streets have been kept cleaner at an 
approximate cost of $1,000 per month less. 

Motorization of the street cleaning appa- 
ratus has been begun. Two motor trucks and 
a motor flusher have been purchased and two 
automobiles furnished to increase the efficiency 
of the department- 

Open gambling existed in Niagara Falls at 
the time of the institution of the new govern- 
ment. Gambling paraphernalia has been con- 
fiscated and burned and resorts raided, until 
open violation of the law is no more. 

As for the future, the work of reorgani- 
zation is going on. The administration es- 
timates a saving of thousands of dollars 
from cooperation, codrdination, purchasing, 
and from the sale of garbage, from which 
there has been no previous revenue. 

We had an interesting experience in try- 
ing out codperation. In connection with 
cleaning a main street in bad condition 
from winter snow, a detail of three firemen 
was requested. They were to direct a hose 
nozzle in order to turn a stream of water 
upon an accumulation of dirt and slush. 
It was thought that their experience with 
the power and nozzle would protect pedes- 
trians. They refused to obey the order of 
their chief, on the ground that they were 
asked to perform a duty not consistent with 
their position. They were promptly sus- 
pended. At the hearing given them within 
the ten days they were found guilty of dis- 
obedience as charged. They were rein- 
stated with loss of their pay and with the 
understanding that it is the duty of every 
employe of the city to obey his superior 
officer. There is hope that new municipal 
ideals will succeed in developing among the 
men a willingness to give themselves hon- 
estly to municipal service. Let us hope, too, 
that faith in the service be a part of their 
creed,

Residential Sections Beyond the 
Hills 


SAN Francisco, Cat.—The topography 
of many cities has acted as a check upon 
growth. In San Francisco the hills have 
for a quarter of a century proven a barrier 
to the expansion and development of both 
the business and residential districts. For- 
tunately, they will no longer prove ob- 
stacles, as tunnels have been designed to 
pierce them and ease the way for business 
and traffic. One of these tunnels has re- 
cently been completed on Stockton Street 
and opens up the North Beach section. 
This tunnel is primarily for vehicle and 
street car traffic, but provision has also been 
made for the pedestrian. 

Over 10,000 acres of some of the best 
residential territory in San Francisco, on 
easy, sunny southwest slopes, will be opened 
up for settlement on completion of the 
Twin Peaks Tunnel and the operation of 
the rapid transit traction line through it. 
It is expected that this work will be com- 
pleted within the next two years. The 
time of transit, passing from the present 
end of Market Street to the Ingleside Dis- 
trict, will be reduced to eight minutes. 
Thus by tunnels and grading, the obstruc- 
tions of hilly topography may be overcome, 
provided the citizens have enterprise and 
funds for engineering development work 

The engineer of to-day is guided more by 
the practical than by the esthetic, but he 
regards it as an ideal condition when he 
can combine the two. By contour streets 
of easy grades some of the most picturesque 
hillsides of San Francisco, which have been 
ruined by the rectangular street system, 
could have been made the most attractive 
home sites imaginable. In the districts that 
are being laid out on the sloping ground 
beyond the Twin Peaks, broad winding 
roads, easy grades and artistic parking 
spaces are finding favor, and add to the at- 
tractiveness of the adjoining property. In 
the more recently developed districts these 
have been adopted, and San Francisco will 
maintain her reputation for diversity and 
cosmopolitanism by having in the down-

Service Test Roads in Philadelphia 

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—The forthcoming 
annual report of the Bureau of Highways 
and Street Cleaning for the year 1915, now 
in press, will contain much detailed infor- 
mation of value to engineers regarding 
Philadelphia’s 
with two service test roads. 

For the purpose of comparison of the 
latest practice and theories in concrete road 


experience in connection 


construction, a service test road over two 
miles in length was constructed on Oxford 
Pike. The construction was commenced 
on October 5, 1914, and continued until De- 
cember 4, 1914, when on account of cold 
weather it was discontinued until March 
30, 1915. The concrete was completed on 
May 18, 1915, 66 working days being act- 
ially consumed on this work. The bitu- 
minous surfacing materials were applied 
between August 26, 1915, and September 
14, 1915. 

This road, which is known as the Oxford 
Pike Concrete Service Test Road, is 18 feet

e and is subdivided into five principal 


ctions, each 2,250 feet in length, and each 


section consisting of a different composi 


of concrete as follows

Fifth Section—1 part cement; 2 parts trap rock 
{ crushed trap rock 

Each of the 2,250-foot sections is agai 
subdivided into two sections of 1,050 feet 
ind 1,200 feet, respectively, the 1,050-foot 
section having no additional surfacing ma 
terial, the traffic coming directly upon the 
soncrete: while the 1,200-foot sections ar 
further subdivided into four parts, each of 
which is covered with a different type of 
ituminous wearing surface, the four ma- 
terials used being refined coal gas tar 
(Tarvia), refined water gas tar (Ugite), 
isphalt cut-back, and Unionite (a mixture 
of rock asphalt and stone grit). Transverse 
expansion joints are placed every 30 feet, 
half of the number of joints being armored 
and the other half consisting of a strip of 
bituminous material. The joints are placed 
at right angles to the center line of the 
road, except a few which are placed at an 
angle of 60 degrees to the center line. 

The Byberry and Bensalem service test 
road was constructed in 1912 and 1913 as a 
service test roadway and consists of 26 sec 


tions of road. Each section was constructed

The Landscape Treatment of

Kansas City, Mo.—The accompanying 
photographs of Quindaro pumping station 
in Kansas City, Mo., give an excellent idea 














of the landscape treatment which has been 
employed for the grounds surrounding this 
water-works plant. 

We have one gardener employed during 
the whole year who looks after all grading 
about the plant and who attends to the pro 
pagation and care of all flowers and shrub 
bery. He is assisted by from one to six 
men during the year, these men being en- 
gaged in setting out trees and shrubbery, 
decorating borders and walks and sprink- 
ling and cutting lawns. There are from 
twelve to fifteen acres in lawns and flower 
beds at the Quindaro station. Our method 
of keeping the lawns moist and the flowers 
and grass in good growing condition is to 
flood the sod with from one to two inches 
of water late in the afternoon or after the

An Auditorium Armory 

Akron, Onto.—Ground for Akron’s new 
Auditorium-Armory was broken March 20, 
This marks the beginning of the consumma- 
tion of plans upon which the Akron Cham- 
ber of Commerce has been working for 
several years in the effort to secure an 
armory building having an auditorium that 
would be available for conventions and 
other large public gatherings. The Cham- 
ber of Commerce, with its membership of 
over 2,200, also needs such a hall for its 
annual meetings, banquets and other gath- 
erings. 

The building is to be 118 feet in width 
by 184 feet in length, and will have a per- 
manent stage 24 feet deep by 44 feet wide. 
The ground floor will be used as quarters 
for the G. A. R., Spanish War Veterans, 
Women's Relief Corps, squad rooms and 
band room for the two local companies and 
band of the Ohio National Guard. The 
main floor will be a combined drill hall and 
auditorium, which, with a balcony extend- 
ing around three sides, will have a seating 
capacity of about 3,500 people. The city 
of Akron donated the site for the building, 
$50,000 was raised by the Akron Chamber 
of Commerce through contributions from

the people of Akron, and the state appro- 
priated $115,000, making a total of $165,000 
available for the building and furnishings. 

The Auditorium-Armory will be located 
on a block of property purchased by the 
city just north of the Summit County Court 
House, an imposing structure of stone 
erected some years ago at a cost of about 
$450,000. The city proposes later to erect a 
city hall on a portion of this block, and 
these three buildings, with the jail already 
located nearby, will form a civic center 
somewhat after the plan reproduced here- 
with.

Sioux Falls’ City Coliseum 

Sioux Fatis, S$. Daxk.—Sioux Falls is 
very much in need of an adequate building 
in which to hold exhibitions, conventions 
and large public gatherings. Early in Feb- 
ruary of this year, therefore, a number of 
interested citizens launched a movement to 
provide the city with an auditorium or coli 
seum that would seat approximately 5,000 
people. The Sioux Falls Commercial Club 
has been active in this movement. A large 
mass meeting of citizens was held at the 
rooms of the Club, at which a special com- 
mittee was appointed to report on the situ- 
ation. This committee later appointed an- 
other committee which made a careful 
study of the problem, engaged an architect 
to draw the preliminary plans and finally 
presented the subject at another public 
meeting in the Commercial Club rooms. At 
this meeting lantern slides were used show- 
ing similar buildings in other cities, as well 
as the preliminary plans of the building 
which was proposed for Sioux Falls. 

In order to get the matter of securing an 
issue of bonds for such a building before 
the people, the Commercial Club appointed 
a committee of forty of the strongest busi- 
ness men in the city to take up the subject 
with the Commissioners. The Commission- 
ers were asked to submit the question to a 
vote at the regular election on April 18, and 
were handed a petition signed by over four 
hundred voters, nearly twice the number 


required by statute

the city and without. 

The plan will contain recommendations 
as to the width of residential streets, elimi- 
nating waste of money in paving, adding 
to the beauty of the street by having wider 
tree banks and narrower sidewalks. The 
advisability of establishing a civic center 
and additional playgrounds will also be 
given careful consideration.

Civic Improvement Bonds Voted 
Mi_wauKeg, Wis.—At the municipal 
election held in Milwaukee on April 4, 1916, 
bond issues aggregating $3,400,000 were 
voted by the people. This favorable vote 
was undoubtedly assisted by the distribu- 
tion, just in advance of the election, of the 
April issue of the City Club Bulletin, of 
Milwaukee. On the first page of this bul- 
letin the Club’s advocacy of the bond issues 
was prominently displayed as follows: 





VOTE FOR THE BONDS ON ALL THE ISSUES 
Sewerage Disposal . . . . . «. - - $1,560,000 
School Buildings and Sites -- -_. - 640,000 
Harbor Improvements. , . . . - - 200,000 
SN ee, ee i 50,000 











This display statement was followed by a 
carefully considered analysis of the reasons 
for favoring the issuance of each of the 
five classes of bonds. 

The City Council has already approved 
the bond issues for improved sewage dis- 
posal and street lighting systems. The 
bonds for harbor improvement and for the 
police station must also be endorsed by a 
three-fourths vote of the council before 
they become effective. This, however, will 
doubtless be merely a formality, inasmuch 
as there is no apparent opposition to either 
proposition. The school bonds do not re- 
quire the endorsement of the Common 
Council and will unquestionably be issued, 
since funds are badly needed for school im- 
provements. 

A special study of the street lighting sub- 
ject was made by the Citizens’ Bureau of 
Municipal Efficiency, and its conclusions 
were published in a_ bulletin issued in 


March, 1916. HORNELL HART, 
Civic Secretary, City Club of Milwaukee.

Water Waste in Chicago 

Almost half of the water pumped by the 
city of Chicago is wasted through leaks, 
through carelessness of consumers or in 
other ways. Not only is this a serious eco- 
nomic loss—making necessary the pumping 
of large quantities of wasted water and the 
duplication of expensive equipment—but 
the water pressure is very considerably re- 
duced, causing great inconvenience to con- 
sumers in the upper stories of buildings, and 
increasing fire hazards. These are the con- 
clusions of a special sub-committee on 
water waste, consisting of Messrs. E. W. 
Bemis, Ray Palmer and Henry W. Clausen, 
in a report to the Committee on Water Sup- 
ply of the City Club of Chicago. The solu- 
tion recommended by the sub-committee is 
general metering. The sub-committee rec- 
ognizes the general public prejudice against 
a limitation of the consumption of water, 
but holds that rates can be so adjusted as 
not to discourage legitimate consumption. 

In addition to stating in some detail the 
reasons for the committee’s conclusions, the 
report contains the following practical sug- 
gestions under the heading of “Rocks to 
Be Avoided”: 


“The popular opposition to meters is so 
great in cities where metering has not been 
tried, that it is of vital importance to take 
lessons from the experience elsewhere. Me- 
ters can be made so popular, as in Cleveland 
and Milwaukee, that City Councils and the 
public will be unanimously i in favor of them; 
or the subject may be so botched, as in the 
past in Philadelphia, that public sentiment will 
be equally str against them. Indeed, it 
were better to drift a little longer than to at- 
tempt the right solution in the wrong way. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the 
following indispensable conditions of success: 

“ry, Minimum rates must be established: 
By this is meant that everyone now paying 
water bills should be obliged to pay for a cer- 
tain amount of water whether the full amount 
is actually used or not. The consumer would 
then pay at the regular metered rate for all 
water used in excess of that amount which the 
minimum charge would pay for. For exam- 
ple, those now paying on the flat or frontage 
rate $7 or less, might pay a minimum of $4 
for 57,000 gallons per ed or 156 gallons per 
day—i. e., 5 barrels of 31 gallons each. For 
all water in excess of that pao, cents per 


thousand gallons would be pai pay- 


ing a frontage rate of over cy and under $10 
might be asked to pay a minimum of $6 per 
year, and other classes of consumers might be be 
correspondi treated. 

“Although the exact rates above mentioned 
are only suggestive, yet in some such way too 
great a fall in the receipts could be prevented, 



























































May, 1916 


while, what is more important, the temptation 
to use too little water will be largely removed. 
These minimum rates must be so much lower 
than the present flat or frontage rates as to 
permit the average householder to save money 
through meters without any check upon the 
consumption of water for ordinary uses, while 
on the other hand the minimum must be suf- 
ficiently high so that the payer of water rents 
will feel that he might as well continue to use 
all the water that health and cleanliness re- 
quire, since he must pay a price which gives 
him the right to such use, 

“2. Meters must be furnished. set and main- 
tained at the expense of the Water Depart- 
ment and through department employes. 

“3. Meters must be furnished not only to 
such districts and individuals as are known or 
suspected of wasting water, but should be fur- 
nished indiscriminately, so that the meter will 
not come in the form of a penalty for care- 
lessness or wastefulness, but in the form of a 
sane method of reducing water bills to those 
who are at all careful in preventing waste and 
leaks in plumbing. 

“4. The city administration undertaking the 
task must look upon the meter not at all as the 
means in the aggregate of increasing revenues 
to the department, but rather as a means of 
decreasing future investments in extension of 
mains, pumping stations, etc., and of improv- 
ing the pressure. Meters will more than pay 
for themselves in these ways, while if they are 
accompanied with such rates as will increase 
the revenues or even keep the growth of reve- 
nues quite up to the present rate, they are sure 
to bring such burden for a while to the less 
prudent of the community as to make the 
whole idea obnoxious to the people.”

Civic Secretary, City Club of Chicago.

Tax Reform 

Fatt River, Mass.—The Committee on 
Taxation of the Fall River Chamber of 
Commerce has recently concluded a thor- 
ough investigation of the taxation subject 
upon which it had been at work for a year. 
That the subject was approached in a fun- 
damental manner is evident in the conclu- 
sion of the committee’s report, which reads, 
in part, as follows: 

“That taxation of industry cannot be ex- 
cused either on moral or economic grounds; 


that the land value tax can and should furnish 
the funds for public works. 


“A tax on real estate includes a tax on land, 
and a tax also upon improvements. A tax 
upon improvements, so far as it has a direct 
effect, discourages the improvement of prop- 
erty; it is simply a fine imposed for industry. 
It lessens the demand for labor, and therefore 
tends to reduce wages, to increase unemploy- 
ment and to lessen materially the prosperity of 
our industrial system. 

“There are but three forms of legitimate 


THE AMERICAN CITY

income: rent, interest and wages. Production 
occurs through the combination of three fac- 
tors: land, capital and labor. Rent is what is 
paid for the use of a natural agent, which may 
be land, water privileges or power, or deposits 
of minerals. Interest is the return given to 
capital. Wages are the earnings of labor, men- 
tal and physical. We have seen that to tax 
wealth and capital is wrong in principle and 
unworkable in practice. A tax levied upon in- 
terest is, of course, an income tax, and as 
objectionable, in many ways, as a tax on wages. 

“Rent is a community-created value Fun- 
damentally it is an income to which the com- 
munity and the community alone has any just 
claim. In this conception there is no denial 
of an individual's right to own land, nor limi- 
tation of his property rights. A distinction 
must be made between land and its society- 
created value. The individual’s right is to 
land; the community’s right is to economic 
rent, which the community creates. The sell- 
ing value of land is the capitalization of its 
ground rent. 

“As to the adequacy of a land value tax, 
there can now be no question. If all other 
taxes were to be abolished, the tax which the 
average farmer would be called upon to pay 
would be but about 70 per cent of what he now 
pays. If the city of Boston were to assess 
only its land, and this on the basis of its 
present valuation, abolishing all other taxes, 
there would be required for public purposes 
less than 50 per cent of its ground rents.” 


The Chamber of Commerce held a public 
meeting on the evening of March 13 at 
which the subject of taxation was discussed. 
The meeting was addressed by Louis F. 
Post, Assistant United States Secretary of 
Labor, who advocated the single tax. The 
largest local hall had been engaged for this 
meeting, and it was filled to its capacity.

506 THE AMERICAN CITY 


A Cocoon Campaign 

Atitiance, Nes.—Alliance is situated in 
the extreme western part of Nebraska 
where trees are very scarce. Last year the 
Commercial Club purchased a carload of 
trees which it disposed of in the city at less 
than cost. Thus encouraged, Alliance resi- 
dents planted more trees during that year 
than during any previous two years. 

In order to safeguard the trees, and be- 
lieving that an ounce of prevention is better 
than a pound of cure, the Commercial Club 
early this spring began to make war on 
injurious insects by instituting a cocoon 
hunt while the moths were dormant and 
the unhatched eggs were harmless. An 
offer of two cents a dozen was made for all 
cocoons brought to the office of the Com- 
mercial Club up to a certain date. The 
campaign lasted about two weeks, and 
great was the Club's surprise to find that 
the children of Alliance had gathered 15,- 
670 of the cocoons. The children enjoyed 
the search for them, despite torn clothes, 
and with the cocoons safely deposited in 
the furnace, the trees will be allowed to 
grow this year undespoiled of their foliage.

Secretary, Alliance Commercial Club.

As the readers of your City Edition for 
April are aware, New York City is on the 
eve of accomplishing one of the most diffi- 
cult and important city planning enterprises 
in its entire history. The Commission cna 
Building Districts and Restrictions of this 
city has prepared and is about to submit to 
our Board of Estimate and Apportionment 
resolutions regulating the use, height, and 
area of future buildings by districts; and 
maps fixing the location and limits of such 
districts throughout the city. Never be- 
fore in the history of districting has this 
task been so difficult. Future regulation 
must always be based upon existing condi- 
tions. This is peculiarly true of districting 
restrictions, where land values are based 
upon present intensity of occupation and 
present type of use. With conditions as 
chaotic and extreme as they are in New 
York, the task of guiding the future with- 
out causing too great a break with the past 
is a most intricate and laborious one. Ina 
city where great congestion, aggravated by 
confusion and conflict in uses of buildings, 
is so rapidly increasing, relief obtainable 
only by districting is the great need of the 
city. It is a triumph to achieve the meas- 
ure of success which the expected adoption 
of the work of the Commission on Building 
Districts and Restrictions will render cer- 
tain, 

In framing a districting system for its 
own needs, New York is doing pioneer 
work. City planners in this city did not in- 
vent districting ; the system has been in suc- 
cessful operation in Europe for more than 
thirty years. Nor was New York the first 
city in this country to recognize to some 
extent the districting principle; on the con- 
trary, there are many cities in the United 
States where some feature of that system is 
already in operation. The distinctive con- 
tribution that New York has made to the 
progress of the districting movement in this 
country is in recognizing the value of dis- 
tricting as a system. Real districting is the 
regulation of buildings by districts both ac- 
cording to use and according to bulk, 
throughout the entire city, and the applica- 
tion of these provisions in conformity with 
a systematic plan, framed not only in ac- 
cordance-with varying local conditions, but

in such a manner as best to relate each dis- 
trict to every other and with the city as a 
whole; in short, districting must be an in- 
tegral part of the plan of the city as a 
whole. This no other city in this country 
has attempted to do; and in adopting dis- 
tricting in this real and complete sense New 
York is doing work that may be of great 
service to all the cities of the United States, 
both great and small. In Germany, where 
districting has been longer and more wide- 
ly in use than anywhere else, it has been a 
success’in cities of all sizes; and the regu- 
lation of villages and the open country has 
been framed to fit in with it. 

In suggesting to other cities that New 
York, in adopting the districting system, 
has set an example which they should fol- 
low, city planners here would be failing in 
their duty if they did not add an earnest 
word of warning. We ask other cities not 
to accept and reproduce our results, but to 
follow our example. Before attempting to 
district New York we made a careful study 
oi districting both in this country and 
abroad. We did this, not to imitate what 
they had done, but to understand the 
principles underlying it, so as to frame a 
system of our own, suited, so far as pos- 
sible, to our conditions and needs. It is 
this which we suggest that other cities, also, 
should do. 

Many German cities, in which conditions 
did not necessitate it, have to their cost 
imitated the building regulations of over- 
crowded Berlin. Many American cities 
where tenements of the New York City 
type were unheard of or uncommon have in 
the same way copied parts of the tenement- 
house law of New York City. It is against 
a like imitation of our districting system 
that we warn other cities. 

Each city has its individualities which 
distinguish it from each of the others; in 
New York they are so marked as to create 
a veritable gulf of separation from the rest. 
It is not so much that New York is still the 
biggest city in this country as that it is 
burdened for all time with the consequences 
of sins which, fortunately for the rest of 
the country, are still unique. The result is 
that our districting regulations, necessarily 
based on present conditions, allow in future 
building such extremes of height and area 
of buildings in proportion to the lots they 
are to occupy, and an amount of confusion 
of uses and types of building; as to-permit

A Horse will Stand Still Just as

But— 


Map out your traffic so that it rolls steadily all through the work- 
ing day, and you get the last penny of extra profit to be had from 
motor hauling. 

At the same time you get the difference between a truck that keeps 
on hauling and one that keeps on stalling. 


For there are trucks and trucks. 


The lame ones will stand up at the loading platform with the same 


swagger as the real ones. 

But they won’t stand up on the road—and that’s where the rec] 
truck turns miles into money. 

That’s where the Packard truck has squelched pretenders in more 
than two hundred lines of trade—on the road. 

Which is not surprising. 

For the Packard truck is built for the road, in the factory which 
has set the standards of motor vehicle progress for seventeen years. 
Because of Packard experience, resources and lasting responsibil- 
ity, it naturally is built stronger, simpler, more carefully. 

There is a size for every service. From the swift, light one- 
tonner to the 6%2-ton dreadnaught, all are of the same advanced 
silent, chainless design. Write Department L for catalog.

a regrettable increase of congestion and 
maladjustment. New York is also preémi- 
nently the city in this country of the five- 
and six-story tenement. » These character- 
istics of New York have had their effect on 
our regulations. There are still parts of 
New York where the single house is being 
built; there are still parts of it which are 
undeveloped; till portions where land is 
cheap. We shall, it is to be feared, do little 
—less, some of us feel, than we might have 
done—to secure in these portions of our 
city pleasant, healthful living conditions. 
Our districting is altogether too much of 
the congested tenement-house type. If con- 
ditions here have made this a necessity for 
us, conditions do not necessitate it else- 
where. Other cities can do better than we, 
and will be most culpable if they fail to do 
so. We urge them not to wait until it is 
too late.

Results of Pittsburgh’s Graded 
Tax Law 
To the Editor of Tue American City: 

In varied ways our city is beginning to 
get results from the graded tax law, which 
reduces the rate on buildings. Council 
fixed the tax on land for 1916 at 12.6 and 
the rate on buildings at 20 per cent less, 


THE AMERICAN CITY S11 


namely, 10,08. The increased tax bills re- 
ceived by vacant lot owners have caused a 
number of allotments to be put on the mar- 
ket at reasonable prices. ‘These were soon 
sold off and many building permits were 
taken out. I have done considerable work 
examining titles lately, and have noticed 
many instances where improved property 
was involved and there has been a surpris- 
ing decrease in the tax bills since the law 
went into effect. 

The big land monopolists, however, have 
set up a great howl about the high taxes. 
They petitioned Council to appoint a com- 
mission to find some new source of revenue. 
Their report will be watched with interest, 
for the factories will not stand a return of 
the old tax on machinery, and it is so long 
since we have taxed personal property that 
they would not dare propose that. 

I think that the fact that the law pro- 
vides that three years from now another 
10 per cent must be taken off the building 
tax, making it 30 per cent less than the 
land tax, and so raising the latter, has cut 
out a lot of this future speculative value 
from vacant holdings. There is not much 
buying of unimproved property for a rise 
in value. It is going to cost too much to 
wait till the rise comes.

Five Years of Industrial Research at the Mellon Institute 


The Mellon Institute of Industrial Re- 
search of the University of Pittsburgh has 
recently issued a leaflet which sums up the 
results of five years’ progress in the indus- 
trial fellowship system and shows that since 
its origin in 1911 the Institute’s fellowships 
have increased from 11 to 36 and the 
amounts contributed for research from 
$39,700 to $126,800. 

The first fellowship was founded through 
a grant from a baking company which de- 
sired to improve its product. The money 
given by this concern, with the exception 
of small sums for the purchase of apparatus 
and chemicals, was used to secure the ser- 
vices of a gifted research worker. This 
man devoted all his time to the study of 


certain problems of the baking industry. 
Many different industries have thus far 
availed themselves of the services afforded 
by the Institute, and studies have been made 
of such diverse subjects as the chemistry 
of bread and baking, the corrosion of steel, 
the technology of soap and soap fats, the 
bleaching of animal and vegetable oils, etc. 
Seven out of each ten problems assigned 
were solved to the satisfaction of the don- 
ors, and a large percentage of the fellow- 
ships have been renewed. Twenty-five 
patents have been granted to the holders of 
fellowships and there are as many more 
pending. Above all, some twenty new pro- 
cesses developed in the Institute are now 
in actual operation on commercial scales.

by the council solely on the basis of his 
executive and administrative qualifications.

The city manager is to be appointed for 
an indefinite period, removable by council, 
and if time after six 
months may demand written charges and a 
public hearing on the same. He is made 
responsible to the council for all the affairs 
of the city, and to that end is empowered 
to make practically all the appointments, 
and except when the council is considering 
his removal he is entitled to be present at 
all the meetings of the council and of its 
committees and to take part in their dis- 
cussion. Moreover, he is directed to pre- 
pare and submit the annual budget after 
receiving estimates made by the directors 
of the departments. 

The council is elected at large and is to 
be composed of at least five, the precise 
number being determined by the size of the 
city. If more than five are to be elected at 
one time, provision must be made to have 
the members after the first election chosen

Mobilization 


By John H. Finley

l is true that I have been trying to keep 
out of the schools distinctively military 
training, but that does not mean that I 

am opposed to preparedness. On the other 
hand, I am wishing that the state might 
conscript everybody to give some service to 
the state, under a plan of constructive pre- 
paredness, commandeer every selfish luxury 
and waste and indulgence, call to the colors 
periodically every useful skill and science 
and art and industry, and compel a general 
mobilization for the common defense of 
our ideals, but not alone with the gun. And 


I am opposed to compelling the boys in 
school to take the gun end of it except as a 
final necessity, not because I want them to 
be spared any hardness or discipline, but 
because I do not want them to carry into a 
new generation the idea that this fighting 





with the gun is the supreme or only valor o1

the blood of our world brothers, but it were

in all decisions. 


It is indispensable to the efficient management of any public 
utility, as well as to the conduct of any business with public service 
interests. 


Its purpose is not solely to compile legal precedents, but to 
furnish current information to every department of a public utility 
upon the vital matters affected by the progress and change in Com- 
mission regulation. By using the complete index-digest in each 
weekly number of the ‘‘Advance Sheets’’ and the Classification of 
Subjects by Utilities, every department chief can constantly keep in 
touch with every commission action affecting the particular features 
of operation for which he is responsible, with the minimum expendi-

pp. Statistical tables. 50 cents 

To stimulate thought on the city as a social at 
governmental factor, this book sketches a broad out 
line of the functions properly termed municipal. The 
ocation and purpose of cities are first discussed, ther 
the governments of five large American cities are 
analyzed. Three chapters are devoted to municipa 
finance, the protection of property, life and health, and 
education. Public utilities are discussed, as is the prot 
lem of state regulation and public and private owner 
ship. Under “Housing, Transit and Location of Fa 
tories” are considered congestion of population, ray 
transit and the influence of the character of 
upon citizenship. The effect of the « 
zens is described in the last chapter, the auth t 
taining that city life to-day stifles the mind of the «

VERYONE accepts the word “Sterling” as guaranteeing top-notch 
quality in silverware. Likewise, to hundreds of road contractors 
and officials the words ‘Panama Giant” immediately suggest the 
paramount quality in road machinery. The “Panama Line” has 
been built up to a high standard and their high reputation won 
by sheer merit. 





The ‘‘ Panama Giant”’ is a big, strong machine, embodying all 
the general good points of approved road machine construction together with 
several exclusive valuable features. It is furnished, when desired, with a scarifier, 
which really gives two machines in one, has roller bearing wheels, worm gears 
throughout and—but, if you are not familiar with this machine and the several 
others comprising the ‘‘ Panama Line’’ send the coupon for catalog. 


The “Boston” Grader 


This practical, low-priced grader is also built ‘‘up to Panama standard”’ and thus assures 
absolute satisfaction. 





It is built to meet the requirements of a drag, a two-horse grader 
and a four-horse grader—all in one machine. This is possible 

because the special design and quality of material used 
% make it light enough for two horses but strong enough for 
% four, and it has had the largest sale of any similar

to aid in the improvement of health conditions if the 
right method is followed to attract their interest. In 
this book he treats simply the fundamental problems 

f community hygiene in the home, the school and in 

the community life in general. The first part of the 

book, dealing with the home, discusses health condi 
tions in the kitchen, the pantry, the cellar, the bed 
room, the bathroom, the laundry, etc. Next the school 
is considered as to dust, heating, ventilating and 
allied problems. The last part of the book tells about 
pure-food laws, food inspection, water supply, sewage 
and garbage disposal, street cleaning, parks and play 
grounds, insect extermination, industrial hygiene ar 

smoke prevention A final chapter shows “How Chil

THE AMERICAN CITY 






GASOLENE IS MORE DANGEROUS 
THAN DYNAMITE 


Dynamite will only explode from two or three causes, 
easily guarded against, but the vapor from gasolene will 
explode from many causes. 

You can see dynamite and beware of it—but gasolenc 
vapor is invisible, and it is in the VAPOR that the 
danger lies 

Municipalities therefore should see to it that gasolene 
is always stored and handled in accordance with the 
most rigid requirements of the Fire Underwriters. W<« 
manufacture a complete line of tanks and pumps for this 
purpose, over a million of which are in use in the U.S 
and Canada with never a fire or explosion. 

Our Bulletins contain much information on this sub 
ject and we'll gladly send them free on request.

[wo distinct lines of inquiry were followed by the 
Committee on Taxation: 1, the question of the ad- 
isability of reducing in whole or in part the tax on 
mprovements, and, 2, the question of the best avail- 
able method for an increase of the city’s revenue. The 
nmittee’s solution of these questions is embodied in 
ertain recommendations as follows: the adoption of 
state income tax; the adoption of an abilities tax, 
omposed of a habitation tax, an occupation tax and a 
salaries tax, for the city of New York (in the event 
f the adoption of a state income tax not proving 
feasible); the adoption of the principle of a tax upon 
the increments of land values; and, finally, certain 
changes in the existing tax laws with the object of in 
creasing the net income under the existing eye ae 
system, The volume contains, in addition to the final 
report, much valuable material on the subject of taxa- 
tion, in the form of statements, exhibits, testimor

WATER-WORKS PUMP DRIVEN BY 


Gasoline-Driven Centrifugal 
Pumping Sets 

The centrifugal pump has become one of the 
most widely used types of pumping machin 
ery. For years it has been used successfull 
for lifting large volumes of water to moderate 
heights, but it is now more widely employed 
in service where the reciprocating plunger 
pump and the pneumatic pump once were 
considered best. Large cities are adopting 
the centrifugal pump for fire protection. A 
central station having a number of high-head 
centrifugal fire pumps is installed, together 
with a system of high-pressure distributing 
mains. When a fire occurs, high pressure can 
be put on the mains in a moment's notice. 

The centrifugal pump is well adapted for 
direct connection to a high-speed engine, and 
there is an increasing demand for the gasoline- 
driven set for water-works service and stand- 
by fire protection purposes. Centrifugal water- 
works pumps are built for every head and

THE ORIGINAL AND ONLY ELASTITE JOINT 


You can't get away from the law of expansion and contraction. It’s like 
the law of gravitation. Something has got to give when the pressure comes. 
The concrete is not elastic. A poured joint soon becomes brittle. The only 
sure expansion joint is the Elastite Joint. 


Place it before you pour your concrete. The strong body of asphalt 
compound provides ample cushion to absorb the pressure of the unit slabs. 
When the squeeze comes the cushioning is complete and uniform. When 
the concrete contracts the asphalt spreads and keeps the crack sealed tight, 
Pavements don't buckle like this when made with Elastite Expansion 
Joints.

Municipal Bond Issues 

The United States Mortgage & Trust Com 
pany has just issued an attractive booklet en- 
titled “Municipal and Corporation Bonds 
Their Preparation and Certification lwenty 
years ago this company formulated a plan for 
the preparation and certification of municipal 
and corporation bonds, establishing a depart 
ment for this purpose in 1896. It has since 
prepared one or more issues for a list of 465 

ities in 33 states and 75 corporations through 
wit the United States and in the territory of 
Hawaii, aggregating nearly $300,000,000. 

he booklet states: 

Over four billion dollars is the enormous aggre 
gate of municipal securities issued by various com 
munities in the United States and dependencies dur- 
ing the past decade. 

“The necessary precautions against forgery and 
fraud which should have surrounded the issuance of 
so large a volume of securities, have not always been 
exercised. Cheaply printed blanks of poor quality are 
frequently used and the preparation is not subject to 
the expert supervision under which all bonds should 
be issued. The lack of precaution on the part of 
many municipalities in the issuance of their securities 
is disquieting, especially when it is considered that 
such obligations form a substantial part of the invest 
ments of executors, trustees, insurance companies and 
banks For a municipality to sacrifice the necessary 
safeguards in the issuance of securities by any reduc 
tion in expense and thereby diminish the actual value 
of the security to the dealer and to the investor, is to 
obtain their preparation at a correspondingly high cost 
of risk. Correlated in importance with the mechan 
ical perfection of these issues is the further safeguard 
ing at all times of dies and plates, to prevent their 
falling into unauthorized hands. _ ; 

“A company engaged in supervising the preparation 
of these bonds should be of such standing and finan- 
cial strength and permanence as to give absolute as- 
surance of compliance with the highest standards. The 


municipality and the careful investor should demand 
that every precaution be taken to safeguard the 


preparation of such securities. The New York and 
other stock exchanges recognize the necessity for care 
in such matters, and insist upon a high standard of 
engraving and that paper of the best quality be used.” 

The booklet then presents six advantages of 
preparing bonds in accordance with this com- 
pany’s plan, and under separate headings gives 
special attention to paper, engraving, tints, cou- 
pons, personal presentation, final delivery, fees, 
etc.

A Side-Dumping Semi-Trailer 


\n interesting type of side-dumping semi- 
trailer is now being made by the Lee Loader 
Company, of Chicago, for use in connection 
with the latest type of four-wheeled Knox 
tractor, as shown by the accompanying illus 
tration. 

This two-way, two-compartment body is 
particularly well adapted to the handling of 
sand, crushed rock, gravel, etc., and will also 
operate satisfactorily for asphaltum. Each 
compartment has a capacity of 4 cubic yards, 
and the simple method of dumping eliminates 
all dumping devices such as hydraulic hoists, 
etc. To dump either compartment it is neces- 


sary for the driver only to unlock the body 
and exert a slight pull on the dumping lever 
at the extreme out corner of the bod ry 
body is by this means rolled sufficiently to on 
side to allow gravitation to complete the dump 
ing operation 

In a test made in Chicago recently the Km 
model 35 tractor hauled 15 tons of gravel 
this Lee two-way semi-trailer with the great 
est ease, at varying speeds up to 16 mile 
hour. Due to the special front axle design 


en of 
the Knox tractor, this heavy load was turned 
n a 29-foot circle The rear wheel of the 
trailer described a very small circle; in fact 
it almost amounted to twisting around in the 


same spot, the turn of the tractor being

A Pipe Investigation at Seattle 


The city of Seattle is supplied with water 
through two continuous stave pipe lines, each 
of which is some 28 miles long, conveying the 
water from the intake and the settling basins 
on the Cedar River. Recently there were two 
very serious breaks in one of these lines, which 
for the time threatened to cause a water famine 
in Seattle. An impression was gained that 
these breaks were due to the use of wood stave 
pipe, and that they would not have happened 
had some other type of conduit, such as steel 
or reinforced concrete, been employed. The 
Pacific Coast Pipe Company, of Seattle, al- 
though it had furnished no material for this 
line and had nothing to with its construction, 
decided to make a thorough investigation of 
the matter. This investigation was reported by 


SIDE-DUMPING 


SEMI-TRAILER 
Mr. R. H. Ober, consulting engineer, president 
of the local association o1 thx 
American Society of Civil 


members of the 


Engneers. Tl 


lowing statements are taken from the report 
Chere were four leaks, all occurring in the 
immediate vicinity of stand-pipes located at 


summits of the pipe lines. The first and fourth 


leaks were of a comparatively minor nature 
involving a relatively small amount of work in 
the replacement of one or more staves which 


were not decayed but which were defective 
when originally built into the pipe. The second 
and third leaks, however, were of a very 


serious nature, involving material injury to the 
pipe line and reconstruction in each case of a 
considerable length of pipe. It was further 
found that the water contained in the stand- 


pipes in the vicinity of the second, third and 
fourth leaks had been frozen, and that the 
stand-pipes had thereby been rendered in- 


capable of performing their proper functions. 
The freezing of these stand-pipes made it im- 
possible for air to enter the pipe lines to take 
the place of the water which was drawn off 
from the pipe lines in connection with cleaning 
and repairs. This resulted in the formation of 
a vacuum in the vicinity of each of these stand- 
pipes, and the consequent collapse of the pipe 
by reason of the unbalanced atmospheric pres- 
sure upon the outside of the pipe 

It was found that the wood staves of which 
the line was constructed, and which have been 
in service for about seven years, as shown by 
those exposed to view and those which were 
removed from the broken were in 
very good condition. The outer surface of th 
wood, generally speaking, showed scarcely any 
signs of decay, and where decay was t 
it was relatively small in amount, and extended 
toa depth not exceeding 3/10 inch at any point 
observed. It is believed that the injury to the 
pipe was not occasioned by the decay in the 
wood staves of which the pipe was constructed, 
nor by reason of the fact that the pipe was con- 
structed of wood instead of some other 


sections,

THIS ADVERTISEMENT 
IS ADDRESSED TO TWO PEOPLE 


1. To the Man Who Wants to be a 
Chamber of Commerce Secretary 


During the past two years we have frequently found ourselves in serious 
need of men with the ability to make good in this field. We have not, 
however, dared to risk engaging or recommending men unfamiliar with the 
principles on which our success has been built. 

The need for trained men is so keen that we have—simply as a measure 
of self protection—organized a Summer School for Chamber of Commerce 
Secretaries. The school will cost far more than we can hope to secure 
through tuition payment. 

It will be held at Ithaca, N. Y._ It will commence with July 24, 1916, 
and continue for two weeks. 


2. To the Secretary Who is 
Facing Unsolved Problems 


The Summer School will furnish this man the solution he has been 
striving to find. | 

The men who are directing the Summer School are men with demon- 
strated ability as builders. They can point to many vigorous commercial 
organizations scattered throughout the nation, as proof that the principles 
they follow are sound. The development of these organizations is proof 
also of their strength as leaders. 

The men associated with them as lecturers at the School have all been 
chosen because they have thoroughly established their knowledge of the 
subjects with which they will deal. 


The School is Offered on Its Own Merits 


While we have organized it in order to place ourselves in touch with 
competent men, we make no promise express or implied to engage the 
services of any of the students or recommend them to others. 


There is more about this School in a pamphlet just issued. Send for it.
