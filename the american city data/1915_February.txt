U. S. Cast Iron Pipe 


Because U. S. Cast Iron Pipe Culverts possess every advantage a culvert should have and 
are entirely free of the various disadvantages found in every other type of culvert 








save Cast iron. 


They possess great mechanical strength to withstand all loads and shocks bort 
by the highway. 

They resist corrosion almost indefinitely—cast iron pipe laid 250 years ag: 

in good condition and in use today. 

They have impermeable walls of suitable thickne 

They will better maintain alignment—no water seepage in the heart of an embank 


ment. 

They have the highest flow capacity of any type—the lowest friction loss for a 
given diameter. 

U. S. Cast Iron Culvert Pipe is complete when shipped 
received—easily, cheaply and correctly installed by unskilled labor 


] 


and ready tor use whe 


From every standpoint—service, economy, convenience and durability—U. S 


Cast Iron Pipe Culverts offer those advantages which are necessary to good roads.

I wish to state to you that your Type # 12 
Triple Combination Pumping and Hose Motor Car worked 
beginning Thursday night November 12th for twenty-three 
hours and thirty-two minutes without a stop. 

We had a bad lumber fire Thursday evening 
at 6 P.Li. and the car went in service at that time, 
worked until 5:32 P.l'. Priday, November 13th, which I 
believe makes twenty-three hours and thirty-two minutes. 

The car never stopped till we were ready 
to go home and never missed a stroke. It supplied 
t three lines during this time. We consider this very 
excellent work. 

After returning from the lumber fire on 
Priday evening, the car went to another fire that same 
evening, and two the next day, and was ready for another 
twenty-three hours work after that. And confirming 
everything you have said about your triple the Chief and 
myself take great pride in having such an apparatus in

The merits of the Lambert have made water-meter systems popular. 
All improvements which the tests of time and long service show to be requisite in a Perfect Water

Made in all sizes {” to 6” of the best bronze Composition throughout, fitted with Unbreakable re- 
inforced disc-pistons. 





We firmly believe in ‘‘The Survival of the Fittest.”’ 
Here are a few reasons for our belief: 


Cleveland, Ohio, in 1912, awarded its entire contract for Water Meters, in sizes 
5-8 inch to 6 inches inclusive, at a price several thousand dollars higher than that of 
the low bidder, to this Company. 
A differential in value based on quality of material used, on low cost of maintenance, on 
merit and general excellence of Lambert Meters ascertained in a practical way by service use during 
many long years, had fully demonstrated their ‘‘fitness to survive.”’ 


A 6-inch Thomson Meter, No. 8217, was set June 1, 1890, at Fort Adams, R. I. 
[2 | Water Company, under date April 29, 1913, say concerning it: 

“In a period of nearly twenty-three years, this meter has worked continuously night and 
day, with only two periods of repairs, one in 1905 and one in 1913, with a total record of 59,715,950 
cubic feet of water.” 


The Newport 


Three (3) 6-inch Thomson Meters set in December, 1902, at Kingsbridge Power Station, 
Interborough Rapid Transit Company, 216th Street and 9th Avenue, New York City, N. Y., 
are still in service and during said time have not required any repairs. 

The numbers of the meters and registered amount of water which has passed through them, are 


eM cn cs 70,435,200 cubic feet 

"5 ai papell 101,085,400 cubic feet 

a ee 98,908,900 cubic feet | 
Oe ees ee 270,429,500 cubic feet , 


Under date March 7, 1913, Mr. William Craig, Engineer in Charge, furnishes the foregoing details, 
and says: 

“‘They have been tested on several occasions by the Water Department, the last test being made 
on February 11, 1913, and found correct.’ 

These three (3) meters, at a rate of 10 cents per hundred cubic feet, evidence a revenue to the City 
in the sum of over $270,000.00, for Water used and measured through them to that time. 

And no expense attached to the owners thereof, for repairs, during more than ten (10) 
years.

Editorial Comment 


Scientific Citizen Farming 

To produce a healthy, ‘happy, efficient 
citizenship is the highest municipal aspira- 
tion. How intelligently are we striving 
towards such a goal? To attain it, our chief 
need is that each citizen shall be interested, 
not only in his own welfare and content- 
ment, but in that of every other citizen. 
Are we really educating a citizenship of 
that type? 

We know that men neither gather grapes 
of thorns, nor figs of thistles; that what men 
sow, that they also reap; and that no man 
liveth unto himself alone. Inexorable 
truths, these, that we too often leave out of 
sight in running our cities, for the neglect 
of which we all pay the inevitable penalty. 

Each year we sow a crop of citizens for 
future gathering. Each year we gather in 
the crop sown twenty-one years ago—or so 
much of it as survives. So that this year 
we gather for use as full-grown citizens, the 
crop sown in 1894; and next year, the one 
sown in 1895. At the same time we plant 
a crop for 1936—and so it goes. 

The question is, Are we doing any more 
scientific citizen farming than they did 
twenty-one years ago? 

\s we gather in this year’s crop, we 
notice that some of that 1894 seed hasn't 
turned out well. Indeed, an over-large per- 
centage hasn't turned out at all, but died the 
first year. In the next few years more ot 
the stock died from lack of vitality. Quite 
a lot of the twelve- to sixteen-year-old stock 
had to be sent to various reform institutions, 
where a poor sort of mending was at- 
tempted. On the other hand, some of the 
seed has attained vigorous, sturdy growth, 
just the kind to pay good returns to the 
city. 





Nowadays, in scientific farming, when we 
want to learn whether cne soil is better than 
another, or whether one kind of fertilizer 
succeeds better than another, we take good 
seed and plant it in different sections ot 
our farm, and with different fertilizers, and 
try out what conditions and what soil pro- 
duce the best results. We've been doing this 
for many years in our cities with our citizen 
seed—the only difference being that the 
scientific vegetable farmer proceeds accord- 
ing to the results of his experiment, while 
our unscientific citizen-growers, as a rule, 
pay no attention whatever to the results, and 
continue to waste more seed, farming along 
the old lines. 

We've tried planting citizens 290,000 to 
the square mile; we've tried growing them 
in rooms without light and air; tried raising 
them in cellars; tried growing them with a 
minimum of food; tried training the young 
plants on the streets, and in the unsuper 
vised dance halls, cheap theatres and low- 
grade amusement parks, feeding them, too 
often, on whiskey and vulgar suggestion, 
and then—when we raise a sickly, stunted 
growth, and find, in addition, that we have 
lost a lot of good seed—we exclaim, “Oh, 
isn't this dreadful! What shall we do?” 
And we answer our own question by doing 
the same thing all over again. 

We lean over his fence, and laugh at the 
immature beets, and sickly stunted corn of 
the farmer who tries to raise good vege. 
tables this way ; but when we see the stunted 
youth and consider the lives lost because of 
our own careless, haphazard way of citizen 
farming, we cannot laugh. 

All this has been suggested by two books 
that came into the editor’s office a few days

igo and sat down with very determined ex 
pressions, as though they meant to stay 
until they had an interview hese are 
Louise deKoven Bowen's “Sateguards tor 
City Youth at Work and at Play’ and \ 
Course in Citizenship,” compiled by a nun 


ber of writers and authorized by the Massa- 
chusetts Branch of the American School 
Peace League.* 

Mrs. Bowen's position as president, dur 
ing the last seven vears, ol the Juve nile Pro 
tective Association of Chicago, has given 
her exceptional opportunities to know what 
growth and 


corrupt the morals of th youth ot a great 


conditions retard the physical 


citv, and to what extent the citv government 


Is Fe sponsible 


In her Introduction, she says 


The members of the Juvenile Court ¢ 
nittee gradually discovered that the city was 
full of dangerous spots for children Uh 
disreputable dance halls, p ol-rooms and 
saloons never closed their d rs They were 
ilways open and the children were alwa 
tempted lhe demand for amusement was 


insistent, the supply of facilities for innocent 
recreation was inadequate, and so year after 
ear the same thing took place and a straggling 
procession of children, living under the same 
conditions, exposed to the same temptations, 
wended its way in and out of the Court.” 

Mrs. Bowen gives a chapter to the need 
for civic protection in recreation, and doub*- 
less she could have written a book on the 
subject. There is something pitiful in the 
fact that from the beginning of the Com 
mittee’s investigation “it was obvious that 
the majority of children fell into difficulties 
through their search for recreation.” The 
desire for recreation on the part of chil 
dren anywhere, in city or country, 1s nor 
mal and healthy, and should have a normal, 
healthy satisfaction It would seem that 
the very least a city government could af 
ford to do in this connection would be to 
see that the commercialized places of amuse 
ment and recreation are so supervised and 
regulated as to make them reasonably safe 
places for the young people who frequent 
them. The pages devoted to the results of 
an investigation of 328 public dance halls in 
Chicago are a revelation of the grossly im- 
moral conditions we allow to exist in what 
we are pleased to call our Christian cities, 
complacently indifferent because we think 
our children are safe 


[CAN City 


\s one of the best agencies to improve 
the conditions she describes, Mrs. Bowen 
makes a_ strong plea tor policewomen 
\mong other things, she says 


Women police are not needed to handle 


owds, to regulate street traffic, to arrest 


irunkards and criminals; but they are sorel 


needed in order that they may adequately pro 
tect the thousands of children and young peo 
ple who every day are exposed to the dangers 
of vervised and disreputable places of 





it, and for whose safety and welfar« 
tiie ty is re sponsible 3 

Mrs. Bowen's figures as to the percentage 
of delinquents found among children who 
have engaged in street trades prove con- 
clusively that the city which fails to prop 
erly regulate street trading is guilty of se- 
rious and costly neglect. As a result of the 
work of the Juvenile Protective Association, 
Chicago now has an ordinance which pro- 
vides “That no boy under 14 years of 
age shall sell upon the streets after 8 
o'clock in the evening or before 5 o'clock 
in the morning, and that no girl under 18 
vears of age shall sell anything at any time 
upon the streets.” 

Here is a result of poor planting and the 
wrong kind of fertilizer: 

“Nearly 90 per cent of the boys in_ the 
county jail come from the congested distri¢ts 
of the city, where the neighborhood conditions 
are very bad and the boys are surrounded on 
every side by evil influences. The home is bad, 
saloons line the streets, and at the back doors 
are the railroad tracks and dumping grounds.’ 

Well might some of our older and more 
congested cities exclaim, “Oh, to be young 
igain, and able to plan ahead, so as to es 
cape some of these evils which now are so 


difficult to remove!” Will the younger cities

No such opportunity for assisting the 
growth of a healthy, happy, efficient citizen- 
ship is open to any other branch of a city’s 
government as that within the proper scope 
of its public school system. But our citizen- 
growers have never seized the whole of 
this opportunity. Various scattered at- 
tempts have been made in some of our 
schools to instill the ethics of good citizen 
ship into their pupils; but no consistent

City Planning Legislation 


lo the Editor of Tue AMERICAN City: 

As most of the state legislatures are now 
in session, there will be an exceptional op- 
portunity during the next two or three 
months to secure the enactment of needed 
legislation for city planning, or at least to 
call the attention of legislators to the im 
portance of such legislation. While many 
of the states have taken important steps 
forward during the last few years, much 
remains to be done in order that the cities 
and towns throughout the nation may enjoy 
a proper degree of control over their own 
destinies. Three kinds of laws are espe- 
cially necessary: (1) Laws authorizing the 
appointment by municipalities of official city 
planning commissions; (2) laws (or consti- 
tutional amendments) giving cities the 
power of excess condemnation; and (3) 
laws enabling cities to establish residence 
districts, to limit building heights, and to 
restrict generally the too intensive or of 
fensive use of land 

The following references to legislation 
already on the statute books of certain 
states may be of assistance to any of your 
readers who may wish to draft or advocate 
the drafting of bills along similar lines for 
introduction into their respective state legis-

In almost every state under the police

zones, (2) differentiated zones of height 
limitation (Acts of Mass., 1904, Ch. 333, 
1905, Ch. 363; Building Code for Washing 
ton, D. C.), and (3) in the segregation of 
offensive occupations. Of late years there 
is a nearer approach to the German method 
in legislation which creates residence dis- 
tricts. This is found in Minnesota, Acts of 
1913, Ch. 420; Wisconsin, Acts of 1913, Ch. 
743; and New York, Acts of 1913, Ch. 774.

SECOND STREET 
Floor plan of The Springfield Survey Exhibition—* One Way” Exhibition—Follow the Arrows 


An Effective Exhibition of a Community Survey 


N Springfield, Il, November 21 to De- 
cember 2, 1914, was held a survey ex 
hibition which embodied many excep- 

tional features and which offers practical 
suggestions for similar work in other cities 

Several years ago a limited sanitary sur- 
vey in Springfield attracted considerable 
attention and stimulated locally the idea of 
a more complete social survey. This idea 
was nursed and cultivated until a group of 
influential men and women, representing 
many interests in the community, became 
convinced that the time had arrived for 
such an undertaking. 

Application was made to the Department 
of Surveys and Exhibits of the Russell Sage 
Foundation, and in due season a plan for a 
social survey was prepared. The local com 
mittee guaranteed $6,000 of the proposed 
expenditure for the survey proper. After 
the local data were gathered and while the 
findings were being worked over by the 
several surveyors, the Springfield committee 
guaranteed an additional expenditure of 
$3,000 for the survey exhibition. The final 
expenditures for the survey aggregated 
$12,000 or more, and for the exhibition ap- 
proximately $4,000, of which total Spring- 
field raised about $10,000, the rest being 
contributed by the Russell Sage Foundation. 
No attempt will be made in this article to 


describe the methods or to detail the find- 
ings of the survey itself. These will be cov- 
ered by a series of nine reports soon to be 
issued for the General Springfield Survey 
Committee. 

The sub-committees formed to handle the 
many details of the preparation and presen 
tation of the exhibition were as follows

The first step in enlisting workers for the 

preparation of the exhibition was the “Cen 

sus of Useful People.” About three months 

efore the exhibition this census was made 

starting off with a lively newspaper story 

with the headline, “Are You a Live One?

A SECTION ON CITY AND 


School Board, a union man, a prominent 
lodge worker, a minister and others, the 
whole group representing a wide range of 
interests, made the census There wert 
listed the names of hundreds of people who 
might be considered “useful” for a great 
variety of services in preparation for the 
exhibition \ card catalogue was made of 
the names, addresses and special interests 
of these useful people On the basis of this 
catalogue forty committees were made up 
on which several hundred people served 

During two months preceding the open- 
ing of the exhibition, a campaign of public 
ity and promotion was carried on that kept 
the subject of the survey before the peopl 
pretty constantly. Enough things happened 
in the course of the campaign to furnish 
good daily stories for the papers; and as the 
campaign grew, more and more people not 
generally associated with “uplift” work 
were drawn in. From 800 to 1,000 people 
took some part in the preparation or in the 
programs of the exhibition itself 

One method of enlisting many new work- 
ers was through the appointment of “codp- 
erating committees.” Organizations of all 
kinds were canvassed systematically and in- 
vited to appoint a committee of their mem- 
bers to represent them in cooperation with 
the exhibition. Some forty church societies 
and many lodges, labor unions, school clubs 
and others responded to this request

Many people were persuaded to con- 
tribute services that would have greatly in 
creased the cost of the exhibition if they 
had not volunteered. They helped partly 
because their leaders were energetic and 
enthusiastic, but largely because the work 
itself was interesting and the spirit of the 
campaign contagious. These services in- 
cluded the making of models and mechanical 
devices, much of the art work, special 
stories for the newspapers, clerical work in 
the office and the taking of photographs. 

All of the out-of-town publicity, of which 
there was a generous amount, was done by 
volunteer committees without cost to the 
exhibition budget. A Committee on Out- 
of-Town Organizations arranged to have a 
letter sent by the Mayor on his official sta- 
tionery to mayors of all towns within a 
radius of 100 miles; similarly the Chamber 
of Commerce secretary wrote to secretaries 
of commercial associations; the county 
school superintendent wrote to many school 
superintendents, etc. The work of this com- 
mittee brought many influential people 
from nearby towns. One town was rep- 
resented by a delegation consisting of the 
mayor, chief of police, president of the 
school board, superintendent of schools and 
principal of the high school. 

The County Committee prepared a series 
of three articles for publication in each of 


the fourteen county papers, and followed up

and interests several different groups in games, 
until they are enjoying wholesome, lively and 
“worth-while” play

The Imps and the Childres 

The “Handicap Imps,” Weak Eyes, Sore 
lhroat, Can't Hear, and the rest, attack the 
unprotected school children and glory in their 
success in a mad “Dance of the Imps.” But 
when the School Board is told how dangerous 
the Imps have become, they call doctors and 
nurses, Test Tubes and Air Pumps, and drive 
the Imps off in a patrol wagon. Then the 
children whe have drooped like tired flowers 
spring up and dance with gladness 


The Tx Birthdays 

There is joy in Mrs. Brady's little home, for 
her Joe is aman with a steady job, and it is 
Tim’s birthday, and Tim has won honors at 
school. But the mine closes, leaving Joe with 
out a job. Mrs. Brady and Tim go to work, 
so that on Nannie’s birthday the home shows 
neglect, the children have become unmanage- 
able and the purse is empty. At last Joe gets 
a job that will support them until the mine 
opens again, and their troubles are over—for 
a while. 

Why the Gang Broke Up 

Four young men, who are in the habit of 
loafing about the streets, decide to break up the 
gathering at a school social center. However, 
when they find their way into the classes, the 
gymnasium, the dramatics, the choral and the 
dancing, they are embarrassed by the cordiality 
of those in charge and surprised at the fun the 
young people are having. Chen gradually 
each is drawn into one of the groups and the 
gang is broken up! 

“The Spring in Springfield” was the title 
of a new type of industrial exhibit shown 
as a feature of the survey exhibition. A 
Space of 25 feet front by 23 feet deep was 
devoted to this feature The background 
was made up of a series of panels 3 feet 
wide by 5 feet high, upon which were stated 
in attractive and legible fashion the prin- 
cipel, facts regarding the nature and extent 
of the leading industries of Springfield 
The floor area was taken up by a platform 


SALE 


raised several feet from the floor, upon 
which were grouped in realistic fashion 
models of the leading factories and indus- 
tries of the capital city of Illinois. Each 
model contained electric lights showing 
through the windows. 

Perhaps the seven most distinctive fea- 
tures of the Springfield survey exhibition 
were 

1. The fact that it was based upon what 
many people feel to be the most comprehensive 
survey yet conducted of a medium-sized in- 
land American city. 

2. The fact that it was organized by the 
people of the city which was surveyed, and 
nanced largely by them. 

3. The exceptional quality of the mechan- 
ical work done by local volunteers in the 
preparation of exhibits. 

}. The charging of a 10-cent admission fee, 
which probably lessened the total attendance 
hut increased the opportunity for the careful 
examination of the exhibits by the thoughtful 
minded, 

5. The very considerable cooperation on 
the part of individuals, firms and organiza- 
tions, which made possible a much better and 
more complete exhibition than the actual 
budget would have covered 

6. The fine example of community team 
play in a purely educational affair, notwith- 
standing the possibility of disagreement as to 
the nature of the suggestions to be offered by 
the exhibits, the copy for which was prepared 
in New York without examination by the local 
committees 


Mary Swain Routzahn was director-in- 
chief and Walter Storey director of de- 
sign and construction of the exhibition. 
Both were from New York, representing 
the Department of Surveys and Exhibits. 

Mrs. Routzahn spent ten days in Spring 
field early in September, meeting with the 
executive committee, developing the gen- 
eral plan of the campaign and conferring 
with those who were selected as chairmen 
of the more important committees. Later 
on Mr. Storey went to Springfield to take 
personal charge of the construction of the 
exhibits and the arrangement of the exhibit 
hall, working in cooperation with a consid- 
erable group of active committees. Mrs 
Routzahn returned to conduct the general 
campaign preliminary to the exhibition, 
some hundreds of committee workers and 
helpers co6perating.

NEWTON SCHOOL GYMNASIUM, NEWARK, N 


Public School Gymnasiums 


Practical Suggestions for the Design and Construction of Apparatus 
Rooms, Dressing Rooms, Lockers, Showers, etc. 


By E. F. Guilbert 


Architect, Board of Education, Newark, N. J. 


HE gymnasium has become a very im 

portant factor in school planning, as 

a modern grammar school is almost 

invariably provided with one, and a high 

school is practically never without one, and 
frequently has two. 

The area of these rooms in Newark 
varies from 3,700 to 4,500 square feet. In 
order that the various hanging apparatus 
may have sufficient length, the height of 
the rooms is never less than 17 feet from 
floor to bottom of ceiling girders or such 
other construction as may support the appa- 
ratus rails. In recent buildings we have 
found it practicable to include these rails 
with the general construction of the build- 
ing, instead of having them built by the 
apparatus manufacturer, as is usual. We 
place them parallel to each other when pos- 
sible, and about 16 feet from the wall, with 
a 16-foot space also between the rails. A 
minimum room width of about 48 feet is 
thus established, although the average is 
much wider than this. 


Windows on the wall should be at least 8 
feet above the floor, to provide a clear wall 
space of 6 feet for apparatus and a further 
height of 2 feet for wall radiators under 
the windows. Sometimes, however, the 
radiators arrange well on the piers between 
the windows, though this is not often de 
sirable, as the climbing ladders occupy 
these piers to advantag« 

Usually in the grammar schools very 
simple accommodations are provided for 
dressing rooms, lockers, showers, Cte... the 
classes not being given sufficient time in a 
gymnasium period to don a gymnasium suit 
before taking the class exercises or to fol 
low them by a shower _before dressing 
again. This proce dure, however, is carried 
out in the high schools, and proper accom- 
modations are arranged for an entire class 
in the shower and dressing rooms. It is 
not uncommon to allow the boys’ and girls’ 
classes to alternate in the gymnasium 
(when there is only one gymnasium), thus 


giving the men and women instructors al

vided in the girls’ shower room, these being 
about 4 feet square, with slate or soapstone 
on three sides and a duck curtain in front. 
hus twelve girls can take a shower at 
once, and the entire class is accommodated 
in six or seven minutes with reasonably in- 
expensive plumbing and yet securing pri 
vacy. Upon dressing in street clothes the 
student returns the key of the dressing 
room locker to the attendant. 

In our largest high school a more elabo 
rate arrangement was provided in the girls’ 
shower room, where an individual shower 
and an adjoining dressing room was given 
each member of the class. 

Gymnasium instructors are provided with 
shower and toilet facilities adjoining their 
own room 

It seems to be the decision of the gym- 
nasium supervisors that they are better 
pleased with the gymnasium over the audi- 
torium than at basement level, even though 
the latter is provided with good light. It

is also important that stairway accommo 
dations should be so arranged as to cut oft 
access to the rest of the building when de 
sired, thus reducing janitor services when 
the gymnasiums are used in other than 
school hours. Where possible it is ar 
ranged to make such stairways accessible 
to both boys’ and girls’ toilets in basement 
or at other floors; usually this is easily ac- 
complished, as all recent buildings are pro- 
vided with toilets on each floor. 

Where skylights are used, we have found 
it important not to provide too much glass 
surface. In one building where the light 
was otherwise satisfactory, the radiation of 
heat from the sun on a hot day had been 
the direct cause of several prostrations, and 
this difficulty was overcome only by placing 
heavy screens on the skylights exposed to 
the south, leaving the north lights unpro- 
tected. 

Running tracks are, of course, appre 
ciated when they can be secured; but ordi 
narily they involve an expense of approxi- 
mately $3,000, including the rough construc- 
tion and the special banking and cork 
carpet. 

It is frequently possible to arrange for an 


observation gallery in some large recess at 
one side of the room. ‘This area, stepped 
off in banks, has seats raised somewhat 
floor, and has the 


great advantage of not having to diminish 


above the gymnasium 


the floor space for visitors during exhibi 
tions. When the galleries cannot be thus 
arranged, they are suspended at one end of 
the gymnasium with about 8 feet of head 
room below, so that the gymnasium floor 
under the gallery is still useful 

In planning to accommodate basket-ball it 
is, of course, desirable to play parallel to 
the observation gallery, and blank walls 
should be secured if possible at the sides 
occupied by the goals Che game needs a 
free area of 3,400 square feet, with a mini 
mum width of 45 feet; and, of course, all 
columns and corners should be padded 6 
feet in height. 

We have frequently designed gymna 
siums to occupy the area over an auditor 
ium. In such cases, to secure proper deaf 
ening so that the upper room will not inter 
fere with the use of the lower room, we 
have laid two thicknesses of double-ply 
deafening quilt over the entire concrete

ing it up on all sides 8 inches. Upon this 
22 by 6-inch sleepers are set edgewise, 16 
inch centers, and bridged, taking care not to 
penetrate the quilting with a nail or other 
wise. Upon this a rough floor is nailed to 
the sleepers, over which an additional layer 
of two-ply felt is laid. The finished maple 
floor is laid over this felt and nailed through 
the felt to the underflooring, but does not 
touch the wall on account of the lower felt 
being turned up to terminate with the fn- 
ished floor and covered with a quarter- 
round. In recent work we have laid the 
maple diagonally, which seems to please 
the instructors, as there is less likelihood 
of slipping when not running with the direc- 
tion of the flooring. We have also noticed 
that the grade of maple commercially 
known as No. 1 is very satisfactory, it 
being unnecessary to use the highest grade, 
known as “clear,” if economy is a factor. 
The resilient effect of this padded con 
struction has had many compliments by the 
instructors and students, but of course care 
must be taken not to secure to the floor 
any apparatus cables which have a tend 
ency to lift, as the floor is held in position 
only by its own weight; these anchorages, 
however, are easily attached to the wall 
Basketball play makes it necessary to pro- 
tect all glass. This is occasionally done 
with wire guards on the inside, but we have 
obtained a very satisfactory protection by 
installing %-inch iron bars flattened at the 
ends and screwed to the face of the sash, 
the intervening muntins preventing the 
light rods from striking the glass under a 
blow. These rods, placed about 5 inches 
apart, make glass cleaning easy without re- 


moval of the guards, wire guards being 
necessarily hinged. 

n recent buildings we have eliminated 
clear glass in the gymnasium windows, sub 
stituting ribbed glass with ribs set ver 
tically rhis being obscure, the necessity 
of cleaning the windows has been elimi- 
nated. The obscurity makes it impossible 
to see the dirt that ordinarily accumulates 
between rain storms—a fact which has 
been satisfactorily demonstrated in win- 
dows in use for two years that have not 
yet been washed and are not visibly dirty. 

Illumination in a gymnasium is, of 
course, important, and it is frequently de- 
sirable from an economic viewpoint not to 
plaster the brick walls. Satisfactory re 
sults have been secured by painting a light 
gray color approximately to the level of 
the sill of the high windows; the walls 
above and the ceiling being white. Interest 
can be added by placing a simple stencil at 
the top of the gray color of the walls, this 
stencil having a design emblematic of 
athletics. 

Ventilation is also highly important in 
gymnasium work, and especially in the 
showers and locker rooms. Steam in the 
shower rooms must be drawn off rapidly, 
or it will be carried by air currents through 
the locker rooms, etc. 

During the construction of some twenty 
gymnasiums in the last five years for the 
Newark Board of Education we have ob 
served very closely the advantages and 
disadvantages of various experiments, and 
feel that we are now producing a highly ef- 
ficient gymnasium at the lowest possible 


cost. 





Women and Town Improvement 
By Maud van Buren 


N a thoughtful perusal of the telling re- 
ports of the Civic Committees of the 
various State Federations of Women’s 

Clubs, one is impressed with the fact that 
club women are finding plenty of practical 
work to do and that they are losing no time 
in the doing. There never was a time in 
the history of women’s clubs when so many 


and varied and useful activities presented 
themselves as at the present moment, be- 
cause there never was a time in the history 


of the world when society was so inter- 
ested in society, when the individual took so 
much thought for the masses. Indeed, the 
social and civic spirit runs so high that one 
woman prominent in club work recently 
remarked, “The women of this country 
have gone stark mad on the subject of bet- 
terment work.” 

Now, club women have not gone mad 
nor are they tending that way. The pres- 
ent activity in civic matters is simply an

“Build Now” 


Attanta, Ga.—In order to provide work 
for the unemployed in Atlanta, three kinds 
of activities were suggested and have been 
for the most part actually inaugurated by 
the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. The 
first was to induce the property owners of 
Atlanta who contemplated building within 
a year to have the work done now; the sec 
ond was to push the work incidental to the 
holding of the Southeastern Fair to be es- 
tablished in Lakewood Park and for which 
permanent buildings are required; and the 
third was to begin with as little delay as 
possible the construction of schoolhouses 
and other public buildings needed by the 
city. Committees were formed to push all 
of these projects. 

The work of the “Build Now” Commit- 
tee has resulted in the starting at once of 
improvements to the amount of $250,000 
which would doubtless not have been begun 
for some months. Interesting data were 
compiled into a report showing that it 
would cost from 15 to 20 per cent less to 
build now than later on. This report was 
multigraphed and a copy sent to every 
architect, contractor, and to the leading real 
estate men in the city, with the request that 
they present the matter to their clients. The 
committee also published an address setting 
forth the advantage to property owners 


[106] 


Commercial Organi- 
zation Secretaries 


who build now, and showing the additional 
advantage to the public by giving the 
needed employment to people out of work. 

In like manner it was found possible to 
interest property owners in having needed 
repairs made. They were shown that the 
small sum required for the repairs would 
mean satisfied tenants and would prevent 
demands for a reduction in rent, and would 
even hold some tenants who would other- 
wise vacate. Such representations had the 
desired effect and the repair work has ma- 
terially increased. 

he Southeastern Fair Committee also 
has made satisfactory progress. An appro- 
priation of $75,000 was granted by the city 
fathers, the county commissioners agreed 
to give a like amount, and the Chamber of 
Commerce has pledged itself to raise an- 
other $75,000. It is expected that work will 
begin on the Fair building as soon as plans 
can be made and contracts let.

A Report on Sewage Disposal 


GRAND Rapips, Micu.—The Grand Rap- 
ids Association of Commerce, through its 
Special Committee on Sewage Disposal, 
has just concluded an exhaustive investiga- 
tion of the disposition of sewage in Grand 
Rapids as it relates to the pollution of pub- 
lic streams and the consequent menace to 
public health. The report of the committee 
is of high value, and a brief synopsis fol- 
lows: 

Chapter I contains a description of the 
present sewage removal plant, which is ade- 
quate as a removal plant, but emphasizes 
the fact that a removal plant is not a dis- 
posal plant. Chapter IT discusses the terms 
of the Supreme Court decree in which the 
city of Grand Rapids is adjudged to be 
“causing and creating a nuisance” to own- 
ers of riparian property and to certain mu- 
nicipalities further down the river by al-

THE AMERICAN CITY 


lowing the daily discharge into the Grand 
River of approximately twelve million gal- 
lons of raw domestic and manufacturing 
sewage, and in which the city is required 
to abate such nuisance. The decree leaves 
the city to its own resources in choosing 
the manner of its abatement, but a time 
limit is set, after which it is decreed to 
cease using the river as a dumping ground 
for raw municipal sewage. Chapter III, en 
titled “The Battle of the Microbes,” points 
out how in a disposal plant the microbes 
destroy each other in the relentless warfare 
therein waged, and how a complete trans- 
formation of the sewage takes place through 
the process. Chapter IV refers to the bib- 
liography on the treatment of sewage 
which is appended to the report; Chapter 
V is a “Classification of Methods on Sew- 
age Disposal,’ Chapter VI describes the 
“Imhoff and Intermittent Sprinkling Sys- 
tems,” Chapter VII is entitled “Modern Ir- 
rigation Sewage Farming,’ Chapter VIII 
takes up the subject of the Cost of a Dis 
posal Plant, and Chapter IX contains the 
Conclusions of the Committee. The five 
conclusions are here quoted in full: 


1. Employ an experienced sanitary engi- 
neer to study our topography, gather statis- 
tics on local conditions and requirements, then 
to design and, probably later, to superintend 
the installation of a sewage disposal plant, 
estimate its cost and tell us what it will do 
when in operation, and whether any profit can 
be recovered from its by-products. 

2. Have him investigate and report on the 
feasibility of working out a plan of sewage 
irrigation farming as a means of recoupment 
for the heavy installation expenses of a dis 
posal plant. We believe, from what we have 
been able to find, that if such a proposition can 
be worked out practically, it presents the most 
likely method of recouping anything com 
mercially for the heavy initial construction and 
future maintenance cost. 

3. The state should assist the city of Grand 
Rapids financially, if constitutional provisions 
are not in the way, in this necessarily experi 
mental work in view of the compulsory decre« 
and the provisions of Act No. 98 of the Pub 
lic Acts of Michigan, 1913, which provides for 
the “supervision and control by the State 
Board of Health over water works systems 
ind sewage disposal systems, and providing 
for the appointment, duties, salary and ex 
penses of a state sanitary engineer, and pro- 
viding penalties and defining liabilities for 
violation of this act.” 

_4._ A disposal plant that is cheap in the be 
ginning is not necessarily the most economical 
or feasible to install. High operation expense, 


lack of permanent efficiency and unsatisfactory 


results calling for its replacement in a few 
years, would more likely follow a low initial 


107 
ost ot a make-shift device, and be the most 
expensive in the end 

5. It ought to be considered feasible t 
work out a plan whereby a sewage disposal 
plant for Grand Rapids, which we are prac 
tically decreed by an order of the court to « 
struct, may be for all practical purposes used 
as a state experimental station on sewage dis 


posal, and the experience we would acquiré 
would then be available for the benefit of other 
cities of Michigan, which will in all probability 
be required by law to take similar action, and 
render their problems less expensive and 
greater certainties from the outset. Codoper 
tion along these lines by the State Board 
Health, together with financial aid from the 
state, should be secured and made of value 
and service to the cities of the state on this 
most important and very expensive municipal 
requirement, which the developments of 1 
ern science show are indispensable to the most 
approved sanitary living conditions in 
and which demand the purity of our n 
waterways.

Investigation of Business and 
Employment 

CLEVELAND, Onto.—The Committee o1 
Industrial Development of the Cleveland 
Chamber of Commerce made use of the sit 
uation created by the outbreak of the over 
seas conflict to determine the truth regard 
ing business conditions in Cleveland. In 
quiries were sent to the following six 
classes of business interests: retail, whole 
sale, iron and steel, auto and parts, textile 
manufacturing, and a class designated as 
miscellaneous. They were asked to take 
the ten months ending November 1, 19132, 
as 100 per cent, as a basis upon which to 
reckon, and to give the percentage of in 
crease or decrease in the volume of busi 
ness transacted and the number of men 
employed in the same period of 1914. Also 
in the same way, taking the month of Oc 
tober, 1913, as 100 per cent, to give the 
corresponding percentages for October 
1914. A second inquiry extended the pe- 
riod for another month. 

The summaries of the replies indicated 
that in all but the retail business each 
showed a marked increase for the month 
of November in percentage of emploves 
over the preceding month The exception 
in the case of the retail business was cor 
sidered negligible because all other per 
centages indicated that this business was 
normal as compared with 1913. The sum 
martes also showed that although operations 
were in some cases curtailed, merchants 
were employing more people at a less num-

Aquaintance Day 

BurraLto, N. Y.—It is the intention of 
the Buffalo Chamber of Commerce to de- 
vote the hours from noon to 2 P. M. on 
lriday of each week.to a luncheon in which 
the members are given an opportunity to 
know one another. On the “acquaintance 
days” thus far held an average of two- 
thirds of the entire membership have at 
tended. 

On entering the Chamber dining room, 
each one is given a tag upon which to write 
his name and address. He is advised to 
take a seat at table, preferably next to some 
one whom he does not know, and to make 
himself acquainted with every other man 
at the table. There is a special menu and 
music. 

The real underlying value of acquaint 
ance days is based upon the invaluable busi- 
ness asset, acquaintance, and it is said to 
be proving very successful with the Buffalo 
Chamber of Commerce.

An Industrial Survey 

bALTIMORE, Mp.—The recent rey 
the industrial survey of Baltimor 1 
available in pamphlet form, aims to present 
an unvarnished statement of facts in re 
gard to business conditions in that cit 
he survey was a private enterprise pri 
jected by Mr. J. E \ldred and carried 
under the supervision of Mr. k. V. I 
with the cooperation of an advisory cot 
mittee. The object in view was the arous 
ing of a collective consciousness and a con 
munal effort which should take account ot 
existing difficulties growing out of the his 


torical change of Baltimore from a con 

mercial to a manufacturing city, and which 
should encourage and facilitate the e1 

deavors of individual enterprise to adapt 
itself to this necessity. 

The survey disclosed the fact that Balti 
more was not living up to its opportunities 
in trade expansion and that marked devel 
opment should be easily possible by the et 
couragement of (1) industries entirely un 
represented in Baltimore and for whos 
products there is at present an actual local 
demand; (2) industries entirely unrepre 
sented in Baltimore, but conspicuously suc 
cessful in similar localities; and (3) indus 
tries now in operation in Baltimore, but ca 
pable of marked expansion. Noteworthy 
examples of industries in these several 
groups are given. 

Che survey covered in great detail the 
following subjects: The manufacturing 
jobbing business, the retail stores, the con 
mission business, the port of Baltimore, the 
housing of labor in Baltimore as compared 
with the tenement systems in vogue in many 
industrial centers, and the relation the 
Chamber of Commerce sustains to the in 
dustrial development of the city; also tax 
ation and its relation to industrial develop 
ment, embodied in which is a discussion of 
the taxation laws of Maryland as revised 
by the Legislature in 1914 so far as it affects 
the industries of the state, and Baltimore's 
geographical advantages 

Tabulated statement No. 1, entitled 
“Value of Manufactures and Classification 
of Industries,” shows the character of th 
manufacturing industries of Baltimor 
grouped under their natural classifications 
The values of the manufactures are noted 
under each classification, also the total 
skilled and unskilled labor employed, and 























110 THE AMERICAN CITY 


the clerical male and female employes re 
spectively. This statement on manufac- 
tures also shows the reported local sales 
and shipments of the different Baltimore 
industries considered in the report. 

labulated statement No. 2, entitled 
“Value and Disposition of Merchandise 
Jobbed,” deals only with the total sales, 
subdivided under local sales and shipments, 
and shows what percentage of the goods 
jobbed in each classification were purchased 
from Baltimore manufacturers. 

In the “remarks” column of both of these 
statements reference is made to certain 
pages in the report for detailed information 
relating to the figures given, and these con- 
clusions in regard to the trade covered in 
each case are designed to inform the reader 
as to the disposition of the wares manufac- 
tured or jobbed and the source of supply 
for raw products. Some of these also in- 
clude comments on the needs of the com- 
munity along the lines indicated. 

Tabulated statement No. 3, entitled “The 
Value of Merchandise Disposed of Through 
Retail Merchants,” is made under appro- 


priate classification, and shows specifically 
what percentage of this merchandise was 
purchased locally, together with what con- 
stituted the local purchase. Reference is 
made in the remarks to subsequent pages 
which contain the trade comments as to 
why local merchants prefer to trade with 
outside manufacturers and jobbers. The 
reasons given by the retail trade are stated 
verbatim. 

The committee urges the immediate for- 
mation of a corporation—which should not 
be considered an eleemosynary institution— 
empowered to set in motion activities which 
would result in an increase in industrial 
activities, in population, in the demand for 
dwelling houses and in the requirement for 
improved and unimproved property for fac- 
tory sites. The main purpose of the cor- 
poration would be to advance money for the 
assistance of small industries susceptible of 
larger growth. It was expected that no 
gifts of money would be made to any in- 
dustry, all advances to be in the shape of 
loans, to be returned to the corporation 
within a stated period of time. 





A Unique Report of Exceptional Achievements 


HAT is perhaps the most unique 
report ever made by any civic- 


commercial organization appeared 
in The Dayton Journal January 17, as a 
summary of what The Greater Dayton As- 
sociation of Dayton, Ohio, has done in its 
first year of existence and is doing. In- 
stead of following the old-time custom of 
writing up and publishing a great big an- 
nual report that very few members ever 
read, this organization has broken away 
from that custom as it has from many 
others in this line of work. 

The accompanying charts are two out of 
four that constitute the complete report. 
Lack of space is responsible for the others 
not being shown here. The work of the 
G. D. A., as it is called in Dayton, has been 
divided into five main headings—civic, com- 
mercial, industrial, publicity and_ traffic. 
The activities, even in its first year of ex- 
istence just closed, number 194. They are 
too numerous to be given even a short para- 


graph each. For instance, all of the work 
that the G. D. A. is doing for those whe 
are dependent on charity is expressed in the 
four words, “Federated ten leading chari- 
ties.” This represents a budget of $47,000 
a year and is handled by the Social Service 
Department of the G. D. A. On the other 
hand the four words, “Collects overcharges 
for shippers,” represents $11,500 recovered 
from the railroads in the last year, and so 
on. No useless verbiage or finely turned 
sentences about civic patriotism or being the 
people’s champion. The whole idea is to 
give to the public in concise but comprehen- 
sive form an introduction to the wide field 
of usefulness to the community that The 
Greater Dayton Association is filling. That 
it is meeting the requirements of the whole 
community is evidenced by the wide range 
of activities, and that it is not just a busi- 
ness man’s organization is borne out by its 
works. 

















THE AMERICAN CITY 


\n analysis of the 194 matters to which 
ittention has been given shows that 41 per 
cent of these are civic, 17 per cent commer- 
cial, 11 per cent industrial, 13 per cent pub 
licity and 18 per cent traffic. Everything 
has been forced under one or the other of 
these sub-divisions for easy analysis and 
convenience. 

In an organizaztion of over 7,000 mem- 
bers, which is acknowledged to be the larg- 
est of any similar body in the country, nat- 
urally the problems are different from those 
of the average organization with from 1,000 
2,000 business men as members. The 
G. D. A. is very democratic and gives at- 
tention to: innumerable local matters that 
ordinarily would not be dealt with by a 
strictly commercial body. To determine to 
what extent this is true of the G. D. A., 
its activities have been sub-divided into two 
classes, those “for all the people” and “for

HOW THE WORK OF THE GREATER DAYTON ASSOCIATION FOR 1914 WAS DIVIDED 


cially is this true in Dayton, where through 
such an organizaztion as the G. D. A., all 
classes are working together. In its large 
membership are enrolled the presidents of 
the biggest industrial concerns and banks, 
and also the men at the bench and in the 
foundry. Still more unusual is the fact 
that over 500 women belong to this unique 
body and they are just as busy as the men. 
They are after such things as removal of 
smoke prevention, market house

Investigating the Character of Civil Service 
Candidates 


By John F. Kavanagh 


Of the Municipal Civil Service Commission of the City of New York 


IVIL SERVICE commissions through- 
rs out the country have often looked to 
New York City for guidance in the 
solving of employment problems, and some 
of them have adopted many of the reforms 
installed by the Municipal Commission. 
One of the most valuable of these reforms 
is the establishment of the Bureau of In- 
vestigation, whose duty it is to obtain com- 
plete records of all successful candidates 
for city positions, not only to ascertain their 
experiences, but also their character and 
reputation in the community. 

Manifestly, it is of vital importance that 
government employes should be not only 
efficient, but of good habits and morals as 
well, and it is hardly necessary to emphasize 
the menace to the public in having dishon- 
est, cowardly or immoral guardians or in- 
structors. Especially is this true of men 
employed as policemen, firemen, or on 
health or construction work. 

Up to two or three years ago little of 
this investigating work was done by civil 
service men, the main reason being that its 
importance was not recognized by the gen- 
eral public, and consequently no funds were 
appropriated for its advancement. But the 
police scandal in New York City engen- 
dered through the Rosenthal murder by 
Becker’s gunmen, and the finding that some 
of the police force had had criminal records 
prior to their appointment as patrolmen, 
focussed attention on the urgent necessity 
of insuring that only men of good character 
should be employed by the city. 

Prior to that time investigations of em- 
ployment, where made, were generally at- 
tended to by the various departments acting 
independently: of each other, and naturally 
were much less thorough than would be the 
case if trained men had been engaged for 
this specific purpose. To anyone conver- 
sant with departmental duties, it is evident 
that such investigations should be the work 
of the department which determines the 
candidate’s mental or physical ability—the 
Civil Service Commission. This depart- 
ment has at its disposal, through the re- 


[114] 


quired filling of application blanks, details 
of the candidate’s experience and training ; 
and in examinations where experience is 
given weight in the marking of papers it 
is obvious that, before rating in experience 
is given, it should be verified. With this 
work thus becoming a part of the Commis- 
sion’s duties, it follows that the Commission 
should complete the investigation and ver- 
ify not only the experience but the char- 
acter and reputation of such candidates. 

In the business world some corporations 
and firms make an effort to learn a little 
of their prospective employes’ ability and 
habits. Most of this is done, however, by 
correspondence, which of itself alone is not 
always satisfactory, as many a valueless 
letter of recommendation is obtained 
through collusion with the applicant. By 
firms as well as by municipalities needing 
the services of employes of whose honesty, 
ability and character it is essential to be 
assured, the methods employed by the 
Bureau of Investigation of the New York 
City Civil Service Commission might be 
followed with profit, and a short résumé of 
the work of this bureau may prove of in- 
terest. 

After the civil service candidate has suc- 
cessfully passed the mental—and where 
necessary the physical—part of the exami- 
nation, he is sent a blank form, called a 
“character sheet,“ by the Bureau of Inves- 
tigation. This blank form provides for an- 
swers as to age, marital condition, residence 
for last ten years, employments since leav- 
ing school, details of education, and infor- 
mation as to arrests or summonses to court, 
This “character sheet” must be filled in and 
sworn to by every candidate and then re- 
turned to the bureau. 

In conjunction with the statement of 
training and experience on examination 
papers, an investigation is then made of the 
statements contained in the character sheet, 
the search being especially thorough in the 
case of candidates for positions of a pro- 
tective or instructive nature. 

A number of cases are assigned to inves-

places where the applicant had been em 
ployed since leaving school. The candi 


date’s marital affairs are also subject to 
scrutiny, and many have been disqualified 
for employment by reason of their not be- 
ing lawfully married or legally divorced. 
\fter replies are received to the bureau's 
letters of inquiry, and a search has been 
made of the police department files for ar

OLORADO SPRINGS, which calls it-

Dimensions of Roads and Pavements—Width, 
Depth and Crown* 


By Linn White 


Chief Engineer, South Park Commissioners, Chicago, Ill. 


l is hardly true that the construction of 

every road or the paving of every street 

is an original problem in itself, requiring 
the collection of data and the independent 
determination of dimensions. For the sake 
of uniformity, if for no other reason, some 
standards must be adopted and rules formu 
lated that are somewhat arbitrary and em- 
pirical. But, in spite of this necessity, the 
design of a road—width, depth and crown, 
as well as longitudinal grades and character 
of wearing surface—should be adapted to 
the traffic, soil, climate, drainage, etc., of 
the particular locality in which it is 
situated, 

Widths of roadways are governed pri- 
marily by the extent and character of traf- 
fic. A highway may be designed for the 
passage of only two vehicles with no pro- 
vision for standing next the curb, in which 
case the paved width can scarcely be less 
than 16 feet. As the importance of the 
highway increases and vehicles at higher 
speed use it and more provision must be 
made for standing room, foot passengers, 
etc., the width should increase to 18, 20 or 
24 feet. A street is generally paved to a 
greater width because of the necessity of 
standing space in front of the more closely 
spaced residences and stores. Twenty feet 
between curbs may be considered a narrow 
street, especially in our newer towns and 
cities of the West. 

The necessity of light and air between 
the bordering rows of buildings, the proper 
proportion to heights of buildings, the de- 
sirability of trees, parkways, and other 
heautifying features, are reasons for addi- 
tional width in streets which generally do 
not apply to roads or highways; though in 
these relations the width to be considered 
is between extreme lines rather than the 
paved width. 

Ina comparison between the paved width 
of streets and roads, note should be taken 
of the fact that in streets the whole width, 
including gutters, is generally paved and 

From a paper read before the annual convent 


e American Road Builders’ Associatior t Chi 
leceml ‘ 
ece er, 1914 


used by the traffic, whereas in speaking ot 
the paved width of a road as, Say, 15 Teet 
the earth shoulders and gutters are not u 
4 


cluded—an additional width on each side 


f perhaps 5 feet, bringing the total widt 


of such a road up to 28 feet. As an instance 


»f the difference that may properly be mac 
in the width of a street because of 

ping and standing vehicles next the cu 
the following instance may be cited. On 
of the principal business thoroughfares 
leading out from the central portion 
Chicago borders public park territory tot 
more than a mile. A double-track electri 
car line was on the street, and on the sic 
next the park the pavement was mad 
feet wide from rail to curb; while on the 
Opposite s1 le. where the property was «¢ 
voted principally to business purposes 
width was 18 feet. 

Manifestly the strongest argument for 
keeping the width of pavements down t 
minimum is that of cost, both of construc 
tion and maintenance, where the total wict! 
between property lines is not cramped 
However, for certain reasons mentioned 
above, mainly esthetic, applying especially 
t residence streets, boulevards and high 
wavs, the pavement shouid not occupy the 
whole width. 

The boundary lines of roads and streets 
are often encroached on by owners of abu 
ting property and the actual width reduc« 


by projecting steps, entrances, pilasters 


buildings, etc. The laxity of supervisi 
that permits such appropriation of 
property to private uses cannot be to sé 
verely condemned. An encroachment 
permitted is difficult to remove, and as tim 
goes on is more and more objectionable 
Encroachment on the _ publ highw 
should be as vigorously guarded ag t 
on private property. In the design of pave 
ments sometimes features of constructio1 
are introduced that reduce the effective 
vidth. such as badly designed catch 
inlets. excessive cross slopes, near the gut-

basin inlet at the corner of intersecting 
streets with deep gutters and high curbs, 
and then, as a means of overcoming these 
unpleasant features, a raised crossing ap- 
proach that forces traffic out towards the 
centre just where congestion is the greatest. 

In the improvement of country and sub- 
urban highways more latitude may be taken 
as to dimensions and character of pavement 
than on city streets 
erally more 


Conditions are gen- 
various. Location, grades, 
drainage, foundation, materials of construc- 
tion, require more individual study and col- 
lection of data. A good road is the most 
potent factor in the upbuilding of a com- 
munity, and it should be constructed to 
carry not only the existing traffic but the 
increase that will be stimulated by the con- 
struction of the road itself. 

Correct relation between the service 
demanded of a road and the elements of 
design, which include carrying capacity and 
durability, is essential in the construction 
of any good road. The proper depth or 
thickness of pavement is a large factor in 
determining the capacity and durability. 
Under modern conditions we cannot get 
away from constant maintenance if we are 
to have satisfactory roads and_ streets. 
Therefore it is impracticable to construct 
so liberally and permanently as to entirely 
resist wear. The Romans achieved this to 
a considerable degree in their roads, which 
were several feet thick, built of layers of 
stone blocks. So their principal roads or 
some remnants of them exist to-day, but 
do not meet any of the needs of to-day. 
They did not know, apparently, much of 
the art of sub-surface drainage or prepara- 
tun of the roadbed to receive the stone; 
and while it is possible they may have 
crowned the surface to take away the sur- 
face water, there is little doubt but their 
roads were rough, dusty, non-resilient and 
generally unsatisfactory according to mod- 
ern standards. Certainly, they would be 
now, and were then, expensive to construct. 
\t that period there were but few roads, 
only between important points and princi- 
pally for military purposes. Now the de- 
mand is for roads everywhere built as 
economically and as efficiently as possible. 
The thickness, no matter of what material 
constructed, should be the minimum com- 
patible with intelligent planning. With all 
the foresight that can be exercised, a road 
good for this decade will not be good 








enough for the next decade, all of which is 
but saying a large part of the road problem 
is a maintenance problem. 


Thickness of Foundation and Wearing 
Surface 


An efficient thickness of pavement in- 
volves all other elements of economical con- 
struction—proper underdrainage, compac- 
tion of subgrade, crowning and waterproof- 
ing of surface, etc. 

With all the kinds of wearing surfaces 
that have been devised—stone block, brick, 
creosoted wood, asphalt and tar composi- 
tions, oiled and water-bound macadam, and 
the infinite variations thereof—there are 
only two recognized materials for founda- 
tions—concrete and macadam. The main 
difference in the action of the two is that 
concrete is practically homogeneous mate- 
rial, the particles positively bonded and knit 
together so there is a beam or slab action 
carrying the wheel road over a compara- 
tively broad expanse of base, while maca- 
dam is made up of separate particles which 
are inter-supporting only and transmit the 
load from one particle to the others be- 
neath. As one particle of stone in the sur- 
face may be supported by two, three or four 
particles immediately below, and each ‘of 
them on an equal number in the next lower 
layer, and so on down to the earth beneath, 
we may reasonably estimate the wheel load 
is spread to the earth base at an angle of 
approximately 45 degrees in all directions. 
Thus, if the contact surface of a wheel is 
4 by 6 inches, and the load on each wheel 
2,000 pounds, it will be spread over approxi- 
mately 2 square feet of supporting earth. 
If the supporting power of the earth is 
1,000 pounds per square foot (authorities 
give from 500 to 2,500 pounds per square 
foot, according to character of earth, ef- 
fectiveness of drainage, etc.), we may con- 
clude our macadam foundation is thick 
enough to carry the load. 

A concrete foundation will obviously 
spread the load to a greater extent than 
macadam, on account of its homogeneity. 
and consequent slab action, and may be 
made correspondingly thinner. Considera- 
tion, however, must be given to the fact 
that the breaking strength of a 5- or 6-inch 
slab of concrete, made as such concrete 
usually is, cannot be very high. Cracks 
occur in concrete foundations on account of

contraction, settlement, etc., which reduce 
the slab action. 

here is another reason why concrete 
pavement foundations can safely be made 
thinner than macadam, and that is the 
greater stability of the mass or resistance 
to lateral displacement. 

If there is a wearing surface of blocks, 
asphalt composition, or other material, on 
top of the concrete or macadam foundation 
it will further assist in the spread of the 
road. The transmission of the load to the 
foundation through a wearing surface of 
blocks can only be safely calculated in ver- 
tical lines with a surface contact the size of 
the block, on account of the vertical joints 
between blocks. . 

The thickness of the various types of 
wearing surface is mainly governed by 
practical reasons. It is not by any means 
true that pavement surfaces generally are 
to be improved by arbitrarily increasing 
their thickness. Two inches is probably the 
practical and economical thickness for as- 
phalt and asphaltic concrete wearing sur- 
faces, because before the two inches is 
worn away the inequality of surface be- 
comes a serious objection, and a greater 
thickness would allow it to roll and shift 
when softened by hot weather. Creosoted 
wood blocks cannot be made less than 3% 
or 4 inches thick, because the blocks would 
split too easily. 


The Problem of the Crown 

The crown of a pavement is a matter 
almost entirely of surface drainage. Even 
though a road or street has a considerable 
longitudinal grade, it is necessary to carry 
the surface water to the gutters. The 
crown probably assists somewhat in keep- 
ing the central portion of the street clean, 
as dust and dirt are more easily swept to the 
gutters by rain, winds and passing traffic. 
As far as the use of a pavement is con- 
cerned, it would be more desirable to have 
it level in cross section, and under certain 
conditions safer. A vehicle turning on the 
outward sloping crown of a road is pitched 
in the wrong direction, and if the pavement 
is slippery, tends to slip or skid. The outer 
rail of a railroad is raised on curves to 
assist in turning the curve and the better 
to resist centrifugal force. On a street 
pavement the inner rail, so to speak, is 
raised, and, according to any method of 
construction yet developed, necessarily so. 


119 


The problem is to reduce the crown as 
much as practicable and establish reason- 
able rules for distributing the pitch fairly 
evenly across the width of roadway. The 
character of wearing surface has much to 
do with the amount of crown permissible 

The following list of pavement surfaces 
is arranged in the order of amount of allow- 
able crown: 


Water-bound macadam 

Oiled and tarred macadam (surface 
treated) 

Stone blocks 

Brick 

Bituminous concrete (mixed before lay- 
ing ) 

Sheet asphalt 

Creosoted wood blocks 

Portland cement concrete 


In this list creosoted wood block is put 
near the bottom because it is a slippery 
pavement surface and needs a flat crown 
Also, by reason of the true surfaces and 
gauged size of blocks, it can be laid close to 
a theoretical grade. Portland cement con 
crete is put at the bottom of the list, not 
because it is slippery, but because on a 
count of construction methods it can be 
screeded or struck to a fairly exact grade, 
whereas other plastic pavements, bitumin- 
ous concrete and sheet asphalt, cannot be 
made so exact on account of the necessity 
of rolling after spreading to secure com 
pression. 

If the longitudinal grade of the pave- 
ment is practically level, the crown must 
be greater at catch-basin inlets than at 
gutter summits between inlets, unless the 
grade of the centre of the roadway is car- 
ried up and down with. gutter grades, 
which is not a desirable method. On streets 
with longitudinal grades requiring water in 
gutters to flow all in one direction, and on 
country highways where drainage is car- 
ried away by surface ditches, the crown 
may be made the same at all points 

The cross section of a pavement may he 
a segment of a circle, parabola, or two 
inclined planes connected with a segment of 


g 
curve. Either of the two latter forms is 
preferable to the first, because a segment 
of a circle makes the pavement fairly flat 
in the center and grows unpleasantly 
steeper near the gutters. The inclined 
planes or parabola “get away” on a quicker 
slope from the center and do not so mate-

rially increase as the gutters are approached. 
lraffic, then, will use all parts of the pave- 
ment with fairly equal facility and ease. 
In the case of roadways with surface car 
tracks in the center, the section 
adopted should provide sure and positive 
drainage away from the rails, and a sim- 
ple inclined plane from the rail to the gut- 
ter is probably the best. 

Whatever theoretical crown or cross sec- 
tion is adopted, it should be remembered 
that in actual construction the cross section 
will be‘only approximated. It is not prac- 
tical to set enough grade points or to main- 
tain them carefully enough to attain the 
theoretical section. 


cross 


In practice, in setting grades for crown 
or cross section, it is common to adopt a 
rule of measuring, say, one-half the dis- 
tance from the center and dropping one- 


Ctat 





fourth the total crown. This will give a 
all-curve section. 
\nother rule may be to measure two-fifths 
the distance from the center, drop one- 
fourth of crown and thence straight to the 
gutter. Other modifications of such simple 
rules may be devised, using three points on 
wide roadways between center and gutter, 
approximating more closely to a true para- 
bola or providing longer inclined planes and 
shorter connecting curve. It is sometimes 
advised to increase the crown on pavements 
having considerable longitudinal grades, 
thus carrying the water more quickly to the 


segment of an cross 





gutters. The opposite practice is generally 
better—to decrease the crown on steeper 


There are two reasons for this— 
the tendency to slip or skid is less, and the 
washing or cutting action of water is less 
than on the increased crown section.

Recent Paving Methods and Costs in a City 
of the Third Class 


By B. F. Miller, Jr. 


City Engineer, Meadville, Pa. 


URING 1914 the paving of 4.5 miles 
of streets in the city of Meadville 
was successfully completed on Oc- 

tober 23. As Meadville is a city of the 
third class, of 15,000 inhabitants, this pro- 
gram was quite an ambitious one. 

The cost of paving is borne mainly by 
the property being 
made by the foot-front rule, the city at 
large paying for the paving of the street 
intersections and all storm sewers and ap- 
purtenances. The city engineer's estimate 
of the cost of the city’s portion of the pro- 
posed improvement was $60,000, so that it 
was necessary to issue bonds to take care 
of the improvement, the revenue from gen- 
eral taxation being insufficient. 

The bond issue was submitted to the peo- 
ple at a special election on April 29, 1913. 
and approved by a decided majority. The 
bonds were then offered to the bond-buying 
public in denominations of $500 at 4 per 
cent for 30 years. Local financiers advised 
that the bonds be made to carry 5 per cent, 
saying that 4's could not be marketed. 
However, inside of ten days after the bonds 


owners, assessment 


were placed on. sale, $33,000 was sub- 
scribed by local investors at a handsome 
premium. But in order that all small in- 
vestors might be given an equal chance, it 
was decided by Council to offer the entire 
issue at par, and it was advertised accord- 
ingly in the local papers. As a result the 
entire issue was taken up at once and over- 
subscribed several thousand dollars—a very 
gratifying result to the local Council. As 
indicating the class of investors who pur- 
chased bonds, it might be mentioned that 
$1,500 worth was purchased by a day la- 
borer in the employ of the street depart- 
ment of the city. 

The contracts for the building of storm 
sewers were entered into immediately fol- 
lowing the sale of bonds, and were com- 
pleted during the year 1913, thus allowing 
ample time for settlement of the backfill 
before the actual paving construction was 


begun. The total cost of the storm sewers 
was $29,000. 
The necessary ordinances for paving 


were gotten under way and completed in 
December, 1913.

Municipality’s Duty Concerning Streets 

Unless the duty is expressly imposed by 
state law or charter, a municipality is not 
bound to light its streets But, if a city ob 
structs a thoroughfare or permits it to 
remain obstructed, or out of repair, or in 
a dangerous condition, the fact of the ab 
sence of lights or safeguards of any kind 
at the place, resulting in injury to a pedes 
trian or other traveler on the street, or that 
a street lamp has been permitted to remain 
unlighted for several nights, may be consid 
ered with other pertinent facts in determin- 
ing whether the city has been guilty of ac- 
tionable negligence in failing to keep the 
street in reasonably safe condition for 
travel. (Georgia Supreme Court, Williams 
vs. City of Washington, 82 Southeastern

Departmental Reporting for Cities and Counties 


How Annual! Reports for Public Use Should Be Prepared and What 
They Should Contain 


By Herbert R. Sands 


Of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research 


HE lack of adequate and correct in 
formation concerning conditions, ad- 
ministrative methods, and _ results 

of our city and county governments is a 
fundamental reason why they are so slow 
in attaining that degree of efficiency and 
economy now so generally desired. 

Although the majority of cities and some 
counties issue annual reports, an examina 
tion of hundreds of such reports by the 
writer discloses that almost without excep 
tion they omit matter which they should 
contain, and contain matter which should 
be omitted. In many communities certain 
officials are required by constitutional or 
charter provision to render annual reports 
However, in many such instances the re 
ports rendered are largely perfunctory, and 
are issued only to comply with the law. 
Even with respect to the thousands of pub 
lic officials who do not depend on legal re 
quirements for inspiration to make reports, 
but who actually desire to render a true 
accounting of their stewardship, it appears 
that almost all have either failed to realize 
the importance of the reporting function or 
have included only those subjects concern 
ing which a creditable showing could be 
made. 

Most public officials give no thought 
whatever to the matter of reporting until 
after the close of a fiscal year. Even then 
the duty of preparing a report is usually 
delegated to a clerk with what is, in effect, 
a “blanket authority.” No directions as to 
kind or quantity of information or forms 
of statements are given. The clerk usually 
takes the last preceding report as a guide 
and perhaps supplements it with some of 
his or her own originality. So long as 
such reporting methods are continued in 
general use, there will continue to be a 
lack of accurate information by the people 
concerning their city and county govern- 
ments. Just as it is more difficult to make 


progress in darkness than in the light of 


day, so will the present forward movement 


for more efficient government move more 


[126] 


slowly than it might if aided by the light 
of complete and accurate information. 
Purpose of Annual Reports 

lhe purpose of an annual report of a 
city or county department should be to in- 
form the public of (1) results secured dur- 
ing the year and the cost thereof, (2) ex- 
isting conditions and problems, and (3) fu- 
ture program for accomplishment. A re- 
port conforming to these three require- 
ments will also serve a fourth purpose— 
i. e., afford a basis for judgment of the rela- 
tive efficiency of the department head as a 
public official, and of the organization and 
inethods used by him in transacting the 
public business. 


Standardized Reporting 

lf the administrative reports of any de- 
partment are to serve the purpose which 
they should and can serve, it is necessary 
that a set of definite standards be agreed 
upon before the task of report compilation 
is begun. The setting up of such standards 
is commonly known as _ standardization 
By standardization of reports is meant not 
the setting up of a standard which will be 
uniform for all departments and offices of 
1 city, county or state, but the working out 
ind adoption of standard forms and rules 
for each particular department and office. 
The usual practice of including in a report 
only such information as is available from 
existing books of record, and particularly 
such information as makes a good showing, 
is entirely wrong. 

In setting out to standardize reporting 
methods, a complete change is necessary at 
the very foundation of the reporting pro- 
cedure. Instead of reporting along the 
lines of the information which the existing 
records have develeped, a decision should 
be reached after careful consideration as 
to what kinds of information should be 
reported. Having reached such decision, 
books of record should be designed which 
will provide that kind of information and 
provide it in a form which lends itself most

Quality Versus Quantity 
Many administrative reports have thei 
value destroyed by the mere fact that th 


1 


are too large—they contain too much ma 


terial. A prospective reader is discourag¢ 


1 1 


by the ve ry appearance of such volume 
from even opening the covers there 
[he reports formerly issued by the cities 
oT Buffalo, N me and Boston, Mass., wert 
in this class. 

Many reports are made bulky becaus 
they include the names of all 


persons t 
whom payments were made during the p¢ 
riod under review. For example, eve! 
Greater New York prior to 1907 published 
a quarterly report which set forth not onl 
| : 
the name of every payee in whose favor 
warrant was drawn during the quarter, but 
also the purpose for which the warrant 
was drawn, the date, number and_ the 
amount thereof, and the fund or appropria 
tion against which it was. chargeable 
Finally the officials awoke to the fact that 
such information was of no value in a pub 
lic report and benefited no one except the 
printers 
With respect to many smaller cities, thei: 
sin in this respect has been less only becaus« 
of the lesser volume of business. \ good 
example thereof is furnished in an analysis 
recently made of the annual register of 
1913 of a prominent New England city of 
about 100,000 population. This report 
weighed 3.4 pounds and cost $2.61 per copy 
for printing alone. The cost of sending 
by mail was 27 cents a copy, and 25 cents 
to send it by express. It contained 1,194 
pages, of which 600, or 50 per cent, should 
have been eliminated. These 600 page: 
were used as follows: 
59 pages entirely blank

69 pages giving the exact locatior f «

Functionalizing the Report 











128 THE AMERICAN CITY 


cumbering an annual report therewith, it 
should be bound separately and a fewer 
number of copies thereof should be printed. 
Not only will this method keep down the 
cost of printing, but it will also make the 
cost of distribution less. 

The same plan may be used with respect 
to the material above referred to, which, 
although having no report value, must, 
nevertheless, be printed because of charter 
or statutory requirements. This also should 
be bound separately and a lesser quantity 
printed. 

With respect to subjects of special in- 
terest, such as the bird and tree life re- 
ferred to, small paper-covered pamphlets 
may be issued not only at the end of a 
year, but from time to time during the year 
as desired, and circulated among persons 
who are interested in those particular sub- 
jects. In fact, the use of pamphlets as sup- 
plemental to annual reports can frequently 
be extended with advantage to many sub- 
jects, particularly in a health department. 


The Unit Basis 

It is only of comparatively recent date 
that administrative officials have begun to 
realize the importance of keeping their 
records and rendering reports on a unit 
basis. As a matter of fact, this is the only 
method which affords a basis for adequate 
judgment. Reports of lump sum expendi- 
tures or revenues, or of any kind of fiscal 
statistics in the aggregate, usually have no 
significance whatever or are misleading. 
For example, a statement that it cost $26,- 
990 to clean the streets of a city last year 
as against $23,560 the prior year means 
practically nothing. Similarly useless is a 
statement that the food supplies of an in- 
stitution cost only $8,500 last year as 
against $11,000 the prior year. In the for- 
mer instance probably a new area of streets 
had been paved and hence a larger number 
of square yards had been cleaned, or per- 
haps the streets were cleaned much better. 
In the latter instance it would be probable 
that a fewer number of meals had been 
served. These statements should have been 
prepared respectively on a square yard and 
inmate day basis. 

In this connection it is of supreme impor- 
tance that the proper units be selected as 
a basis for compiling statistics and for 
comparisons. Continuing the street-clean- 
ing illustration, it is important that the 


cost per square yard or per ten thousand 
square yards (“great square’) be shown, 
not merely for all of the streets of the com- 
munity, but with respect to each of the 
several different methods of cleaning used, 
whether by hand, by machine, by flushing, 
by squeegeeing, or by a combination of two 
or more of these methods. Similarly with 
respect to refuse collected and removed, it 
is important that garbage, rubbish, ashes 
and sweepings be reported not only on a 
cubic yard or ton basis, but separately so 
far as possible, because of the different 
conditions and methods involved. 

With respect to selecting a unit basis for 
institutional reporting, it is important to 
state all of the factors which are embraced. 
For example, unit costs per patient day 
may or may not include water and light 
furnished to the institution. Similarly, they 
may or may not include depreciation of the 
plant. 


Value of Comparisons 

Comparisons are of great value in any 
report. In making comparisons it is im- 
portant that all of the conditions and fac- 
tors which tend to influence increases or 
decreases should be clearly stated. Com- 
parisons should be set forth by the use of 
separate columns for increases and de- 
creases respectively. It is not sufficient to 
use these two columns alone without show- 
ing all of the figures compared. Some re- 
porters use small plus or minus signs to 
designate increases or decreases, and place 
them all in a single column. This is con- 
fusing and renders it difficult to grasp the 
significance of the facts. 

Not only are comparisons with prior pe- 
riods of much value, but also comparisons 
with set standards. In fact, the latter are 
of as much and often of more value. For 
example, a comparison of the cost of clean- 
ing sewer catch basins as between two fiscal 
periods might show a decrease. This in 
itself would be a creditable showing for 
the official in charge. However, it may 
have been previously demonstrated that 
such basins could be cleaned at a much 
lower cost. This latter would constitute 
a standard and should be used as a basis 
of comparison as well as the prior period. 
Wherever standards have been established 
for a given kind of service, they should be 
stated in the report and comparisons made 
therewith. It is to be regretted that city

THE AMERICAN CITY 


and county governments have not devel- 
oped the practice of establishing standards 
for the several kinds of service as have 
private corporations. There is no good 
reason why nearly every kind of service 
rendered by a city or county could not be 
standardized and the efficiency of admin- 
istration judged by measuring results ac- 
complished against such standards. This 
should be an aim of the many efficiency bu- 
reaus established in local governments 
throughout the country. 

In making comparisons with prior years 
it is not sufficient to use omly one year. 
The number of years to be inc:uued de- 
pends upon the kind of service or work 
which is being reported. In certain cases 
one or two years may be adequate and in 
others nothing less than five years should 
suffice. Having shown an annual compari- 
son of from two to five years, it is fre- 
quently of advantage to insert the averages 
of five- or ten-year periods back over a 
space of twenty or more years. Thus a 
comprehensive picture is afforded in a mini- 
mum space. 


Percentages and Averages 

The use of percentages in reporting is 
becoming more common each year and has 
not yet reached the maximum. However, a 
tendency is already manifest to misuse the 
percentage method by disregarding the car- 
dinal rule that, wherever percentages are 
used in making comparisons or in stating 
related facts, they must all be computed 
on the same basis. Unless this is done per- 
centages are misleading and might better 
be omitted entirely. Particularly is there 
a liability to misuse the percentage method 
when reports are prepared by inexperienced 
persons. 

In using percentages it is important that 
the figures on which they are based should 
also be stated. This will help to guard 
against misleading conclusions, because the 
reader himself can verify the correctness 
of the percentage. Moreover, it is possible 
to insert too many percentages, so as act- 
ually to confuse the reader rather than aid 
him. 

The best way to handle percentages is to 
explain them fully in the text matter which 
accompanies the statistical part of the re- 
port. In fact, some of our best statisticians 
use very few percentages in their tabular 
matter, but confine the use thereof to their 
discussion of the conclusions and deduc- 





129 


tions as set forth in the text of the report. 

Averages, like percentages, are of much 
value when used properly. There are many 
instances when the statement of an averag« 
figure means nothing. Here again it is usu 
ally desirable to explain in the text or in 
a footnote the qualifying conditions which 
enter into the use of averages. Like per- 
centages, they should never be used alone. 
The figures on which an average is com 
puted should always be stated. The aver- 
ages are of most value when used in the 
preparation of unit costs. These latter al- 
ways represent an average for the period 
under review. 


Plant and Equipment 

The writer has examined many reports 
which list in great detail the various equip- 
ment of the department or bureau. Page 
after page is often used to set forth the 
location and size of real estate holdings. 
Similarly many pages are used to enumer- 
ate equipment—desks of sundry sizes and 
styles, chairs of equal variety, typewriters, 
adding machines, coat and hat racks, etc. 

As a rule such matter should have no 
place in an annual report. All land and 
buildings owned by a government should 
be a matter of record in detail accounts of 
a property ledger kept in the department 
having jurisdiction thereover, and also in 
the central accounting office. Being under 
central accounting control and constituting 
part of the assets of a city, it is proper to 
include it as one of the items of the balance 
sheet. In fact, such an item may, with 
reason, be supported by a schedule showing 
the value of the principal classes or groups 
of property entering into the total amount 
Beyond this there is ordinarily no justifica- 
tion for including such matter in a printed 
report, although, as pointed out below, this 
is not proposed as an arbitrary rule. 

In the case of equipment there are rea- 
sons why certain kinds should be listed. 
While there can never be excuse for pub 
lishing descriptions of office furniture, 
there is a genuine demand for information 
covering equipment for street cleaning, 
street construction and maintenance, street 
lighting, fire-fighting, police work, garbage 
and refuse collection and disposition, water 
pumping and filtration. In all of these 
functions and in some others, modern 
thought has been active. New ideas and 
better equipment are being constantly 
sought. While the publication of descrip- 








== See 

















130 THE AMERICAN CITY 


tions of such equipment may not be as sig 
nificant to the citizens of the government 
issuing the report as to the officials of othe 
communities, still the value to the latte 
by reason of the exchange of reports be 
tween all cities, is sufficient to justify the 
extra labor and cost involved 

’ractically every \merican city and 
county is still in the experimental stage 1n 
deciding on what is the most efficient and 
economic street cleaning equipment, Som 
officials advocate dry cleaning and others 
wet cleaning. Some praise the work of 
certain kinds of sweeping machines, flush 
ing machines and squeegees, while others 
deprecate it with equal ardor. Sund 
kinds of motor equipment are being ‘intro 
duced in lieu of horse-drawn equipment, 
and opinion is yet divided as to the rela- 
tive merits of the various motors Hence 
it is that the reporting of quantity and cost 
of work pe rformed should be supplemented 
by a description of the kinds and quantity 
of equipment used 

Kqually desirable is it to describe briefly 
the equipment used in constructing and re 
pairing streets and roads. The character 
and size of the asphalt plant, stone crush 
ers, Wagons, auto trucks and tractors, roll 
ers, etc., all have a bearing on the quality, 
quantity and cost of the work done and ar« 
of value to anyone who is interested in such 
work, 

Street lighting equipment is no less im 
portant. Cities throughout the country are 
vying with one another as to the relative 
brilliancy of their “white ways.” Many 
different kinds, sizes and groupings of 
lamps are used. Even the height and spac 
ing of the poles are of interest to those in 
terested at all in the subject. 

The value of de scribing the kinds of fire 
fighting equipment is obvious. Fire de- 
partments in all our cities are being motor 
ized. Each city 1S seeking the best. Each 
wants to know what the other has and the 
results obtained therewith. 

It may not seem that police equipment 
is of enough importance to merit report, 
yet the very fact of its reporting will prove 
the value. For example, the writer recenth, 
saw an inspection of the revolvers carried 
by the police in a city of 250,000 population 
and nearly every known make of revolver 
was represented. The calibers also varied 
greatly. There are a few revolvers that 


are superior to others for police work and 
should be adopted as standard. Similarly 
the caliber used by each city should be 
standardized. As to police signal Systems, 
patrol wagons, autos, motorcycles, there 
is equal need of attention. So simple a 
matter as uniforms of the men is an im- 
portant factor in their work. Many newly 
appointed police chiefs like to inaugurate 
new styles of uniforms—sometimes of their 
own designing. The weight of the mate 
rial, both in winter and summer uniforms 
is really a factor no less important than 
the design. Also whether the cloth keeps 
pressed, whether the coat hinders running, 
whether the cap or helmet is comfortable, 
ire small items but important to good police 
work. 

The search for the best equipment for 
collecting and disposing of garbage and 
refuse is still in progress. The sizes and 
styles of garbage and refuse cans, wagons, 
auto trucks and tractors, incinerators, re- 
duction plants, ete., which are in use may 
be numbered by the score. Each commun 
ty should report the kind of such equip 
ment used, 

lo those interested in the pumping, filter- 
ing and distribution of water, a brief de- 
scription of the plant equipment sheds light 
mm the statistics reported. 

In all descriptions of equipment the re- 
porting officer should keep in mind the 
word brevity. Most of the data should be 
tabulated in compact statement form so as 
to economize space and facilitate reading. 

With respect to personnel it is important 
that the names, titles and salaries of the 
principal officials be shown. It is sufficient 
to publish the subordinates by groups show- 
ing the number in each class, grade or rate 
of compensation. An excellent plan is to 
prepare an organization chart showing 
functions and lines of authority and in- 
clude it right at the beginning of the re- 
port. 


Work Methods 


Next in importance to showing statistics 
of work done, unit costs thereof, and the 
organization and equipment used, attention 
should be given to the work methods em 
ployed. The reasons for this are the same 
as for showing the organization and equip- 
ment. There is in every city and county 
a vast misunderstanding—and to a great 
extent an utter lack of any understanding

Experience in Locating and Mapping Pipes and 
Valves in an Old Water Works System* 


By Carleton E. Davis 
Chief of the Bureau of Water, City of Philadelphia 


OR the adequate control and effective 
operation of the distribution system 
of a municipal water works, the loca- 

tion of pipes and valves should be definitely 
known, as well as the function performed 
by such pipes and valves. Data should be 
recorded in such a way as to be readily un 
derstood and interpreted, and should be 
accessible for immediate use, in case of an 
emergency, by more than one person. The 
more complex the system, the more impor 
tant becomes definite and easily used re- 
corded information as distinctive from in- 
formation stored only in the minds of cer 
tain individuals 

For one reason or another, too much de- 
pendence has been placed upon the personal 
knowledge of individuals, or perhaps a sin- 
gle employe, and too little has been done 
upon the work of recording facts and data 
in such shape as to be of use by any per- 
son, incidentally extending thereby the use- 
fulness of many persons. 

[he lack of proper records and plans 
may be felt in a minor degree as an every- 
day handicap, but is liable to be particularly 
emphasized in case of an accident, such as 
a break in a main pipe. Here the flow of 
water must be stopped, and the circulation 
readjusted so as to cause as little annoy- 
ance and inconvenience to consumers as 
possible. This means that a number of 
valves must be first found, and then oper

ated in such a manner as to produce the 
desired results, and such work must be done 
quickly. 

Of scarcely secondary importance is the 
necessity of similar records for service pipe 
connections from the mains in the streets 
to the properties of the consumers. Affil- 
iated with these latter record are the data 
recording the arrangement of water pipjng 
inside buildings or private properties, with 
special reference to unauthorized outlets, or 
connections with a private, and possibly 
contaminated, water supply for fire or 
manufacturing purposes. 

he situation in Philadelphia may be typ- 
ical. It is not intended in this paper to 
give the details of the locating and map- 
ping work that is being done in this city, 
but to briefly outline the general principles 
controlling such work. 

The original water works of Philadelphia 
were constructed about 1801. The first cast- 
iron pipe was laid in 1817, and considerable 
pipe which was in the ground as early as 
1820 or 1830 is still doing service in the 
distribution system. The present city is an 
amalgamation of a number of distinct mu- 
nicipalities, some of which had a water 
supply at the time of incorporation with the 
larger community. Such water works were 
joined to the Philadelphia supply and are 
even now a part of the general system. 

\s the city of Philadelphia has grown, 
various water supply projects have been 
developed, used, outgrown, and abandoned

in whole or in part. During the last fifteen 
years the introduction of a filtered water 
supply has brought about a radical read- 
justment of the principal supply mains and 
a realignment of the distribution districts. 

Certain general maps and plans are avail- 
able, invaluable as a basis of a more com- 
prehensive and useful record scheme, and 
representing a large amount of research in 
the past, hard work and wise foresight. 
These particular maps in Philadelphia were 
compiled by Mr. William Whitby of the 
Bureau of Water. They are now being de-

limits of the several distinct distribution 
areas, which maps are accompanied by data 
showing the sources of supply for each 
area and a list of valves controlling the sup- 
ply; likewise general maps showing all 
large mains, reservoirs and pumping sta- 
tions, together with detail maps of the pip- 
ing system and operating valves at the 
pumping stations, filters and reservoirs.

TYPICAL MAP OF STREET INTERSECTIONS SHOWING WATER WORKS PIPES AND VALVES 


veloped and expanded with a view to in- 
creasing the amount of detailed informa- 
tion, distributing such information widely 
throughout the Water Bureau, and putting 
it in such shape that a larger number of 
employes can be used to a greater advan- 
tage by reason of its existence and acces- 
sibility. 


Classification of Maps and Data 

The scheme provides certain general fea- 
tures: 

(1) Data used chiefly for controlling and 
regulating the amount and pressure of 
water throughout the system, or, in other 
words, data used in operating the supply. 

Under this head are maps defining the 


on which the location of all valves and hy- 
drants are indicated. The detail of such 
maps is expanded by intersection plans 
showing on a larger scale the situation at 
each street intersection. Each street inter- 
section is mapped on a separate plan of a 
size convenient for use in the field. 

(3) Dataused chiefly for the business re 
lations between the consumer and the Bu- 
reau of Water. 

Under this heading come data relating to 
service pipe connections, such as the loca- 
tion, depth, size, date of insertion, kind of 
pipe, etc. These data are listed in a card 
index and filed by streets and numbers. 

The system likewise proposes under this 
head full plans of all pipes in important

establishments which may have a special 
supply for sprinkler systems or other fire 
protection, Chese plans will indicate the 
relations between pipes carrying city wate! 
and private pipes which may carry a pos 
sible polluted water from a private source 
introduced for the purpose of fire protec 
tion or manufacturing. The necessity for 
the complete severance of these dual sup 


plies can be readily seen 


Procedure in Mapping Pipes and Valves 

Assuming an available force of sufficient 
size and individual experience and capacity, 
the work of mapping pipes and valves pré 
ceeds normally along three lines: 

(1) Compdation of existing data whe) 
ever and however such data may be listed 

Reports and plans were searched and ex- 
umined, though of course the chief mine 
of information was found to be in the mem 
ory of old employes. Considerable tact 
and discriminating judgment were neces 
sary to elicit the information stored in the 
minds of these old employes and give to 
such information its true value and assign 
to it its proper place 

(2) An investigation and determination 
of the present and possible function and 
use of the several parts of the system. 

In investigating the use and possibilities 
of the present pipes, pitometer corps, 
equipped with apparatus to readily measure 
the flow in any pipe, have been used to 
great advantage. 

These pitometer corps served a twofold 
purpose, for while measuring and studying 
the flow of water and determining its fluc- 
tuation, they at the same time detect leaks 
and locate points of undue use or waste. 
Incidental to this study of the flow is the 
operation of control valves in the course 
of which the location of the valves is veri- 
fied, their condition and character noted, 
and other data obtained which form a 
part of the detail location maps. 

More or less information is likewise 
brought to light concerning service pipes, 
even some unknown ones being unearthed. 
Various devices are on the market which 
aid in locating lost service pipes, though 
sometimes nothing but digging will bring 
the desired information. 

Governing the rather restricted opera 
tions of the pitometer corps, is an overhead 
study of the whole distribution field, in- 


134 THE AMERICAN CITY 


cluding investigation of proposed changes 
in the major control system. 

Like the pitometer corps, which obtains 
certain incidental facts while working 
along definite lines for the purpose of ob- 
taining other information, the general re- 
pair and maintenance forces are likewise 
utilized for the same purpose. Without 
adding noticeably to their labor, they turn 
in much that is valuable in the shape of 
permanent records. Each foreman in 
charge of a repair or maintenance crew is 
furnished with a pad of paper showing the 
lines of typical street intersection with 
house lines, curb lines, ete., printed on it. 
Whenever and wherever such a crew is 
called for work, the foreman is required 
in his spare minutes, which always occur 
in such an operation, to list up on these 
blanks such data as an intelligent inspec- 
tion of his immediate vicinity will discover. 
He likewise is required to operate such 
valves as can be conveniently handled, and 
turn in a record of such operation. These 
field records are sent in to a central office 
and are used in verifying permanent rec- 
ords or for making new records on the de- 
tailed per diem maps. 

(3) The proper recording of new work 
and the reduction to tangible shape of ex- 
isting data. 

lhe system in vogue in Philadelphia de- 
pends upon the centralized overhead con- 
trol. All new work is directed from a cen- 
tral office, thereby insuring uniform prac- 
tice and procedure, stimulating branch of- 
fices by the feeling that their returns are 
scrutinized and compared with similar re- 
turns from other branch offices. As the 
attempt is made to sécure results from what 
would otherwise be lost time, or in other 
words, a utilized by-product, this introduc- 
tion of competition is valuable. -Uniform 
practice and procedure are essential, as a 
man transferred from one section of the 
city to another feels at home among the 
familiar records, even though the geog- 
raphy of the district is strange. 

Book records have been discarded as far 
as possible in favor of records capable of 
easy and rapid reproduction. A complete 
and satisfactory record, distributed as 
widely as desired, may not be obtained for 
some time to come, but enough has already 
been accomplished to prove the worth of 
the system. 



































ROSE-COVERED FENCE AND BUILDINGS, ECHO PARK PLAYGROUND, LOS ANGELES, CAI 


Nature in the Playgrounds* 


By Henry S. 


HERE are always people living near 
playgrounds who object to them as 
ugly and noisy. There is no doubt 

that an unfenced playground, where all the 

grass has been worn off by abundant use 
and no adequate supervision has been fur 
nished, will cause property in the immediate 
neighborhood to depreciate in value. The 
natural answer to objectors is fencing and 
beautifying the playground and providing 
adequate supervision. If this is not done 
the play movement can not get the enthu 
siastic support which it needs. 

There are natural limitations in 
tifying a playground. It cannot be turned 
into an ornamental park or a series of 
flower beds without destroying it for play 
purposes, but it is not at all necessary that 
playgrounds should be ugly. 


The Fence 

The thing to begin with in beautifying a 
playground is the fence. The fence is 
likely to be the most important element in 
the layout when it is finished. It serves a 
double purpose in beautifying the grounds 
it shuts off the of the bare ground 
within, and may be itself a thing of beauty

country. The morning-glory, moon vine a tree in the school yards of Washington 


and kudzu will beautify a fence within two 
or three months. The prettiest fence that 
I have ever seen is the picket fence around 
Echo Park, Los Angeles. This is covered 
with rambler roses, which are in blossom 
much of the year. 


Trees 

Every playground should be surrounded 
by a double row of trees, one row just out- 
side the sidewalk and the other just inside 
the fence. This double row should also be 
carried around all the sub-divisions of the 
playground, both for beauty and for shade. 
The trees should be selected with both of 
these ends in view. Probably the hard 
maple meets these requirements better than 
any other tree in most sections of the coun- 
try, as it has a beautiful top and gives a 
dense shade. It is, hotvever, a slow-grow- 
ing tree. Trees are usually planted about 
forty feet apart by landscape architects 
and foresters, so as to give*the tops full 
room to mature. It is sometimes well to 
plant between these such trees as soft 
maples, cottonwoods or ginkos, which grow 
rapidly and may be cut out later after the 
other trees are well grown. The Lombardy 
poplar has certain important advantages as 
a playground tree, because it will grow tall, 
even in the open, and thus casts its shade 
a long way. If Lombardies are used, they 
should be planted not more than eight or 
ten feet apart. It is a rapidly growing tree, 
but is apt to be scraggly in appearance. In 
a double row of trees it may be worth while 
at times to use a smaller and more beau- 
tiful tree like the horse chestnut or, in the 
South, the magnolia, for the inner row. 

The tree that is planted in a playground 
has difficult conditions to deal with, and 
there should be an effort to plant good-sized 
trees whenever possible. I find that a large 
part of them do not live. The reason is, 
as a rule, that they are not really planted. 
They are literally torn up by the roots from 
some neighboring forest or nursery, a small 
hole is dug in the ground, the tree is stuck 
in, the earth is thrown back and tramped 
down, and the tree is expected to grow. In 
planting a tree a space not less than five 
feet square should be excavated and filled 
with good soil. The earth should be put 
back carefully and the tree should be boxed 
to protect it from injury during its first 
years. The estimate of the cost of planting 


was $4, not including the cost of the tree 
only the charge for making the excavation, 
filling in good dirt, removing the subsoil 
and boxing. 





l'rees should never be planted promis- 
cuously in a playground, but they might 
properly be planted around special features, 
such as the tennis or basket or volley ball 
court, if there is ample room. It will be 
a generation before we can get a _play- 
ground shaded with great elms or oaks or 
maples, where the birds will sing in the 
branches and the squirrels and owls will 
find their home, but it is necessary for us 
to make a beginning, if our children or 
grandchildren are to have these advantages 


Shrubbery 


In regard to the general use of shrub- 
bery in playgrounds, there is only one thing 
to say, and that is “Don’t.” Shrubbery has 
little to add to a playground, and it has dan- 
gers that are not to be minimized. No 
place of concealment is good where boys 
and girls are likely to come _ together. 
Shrubbery may be used with safety in the 
form of a low hedge to protect a grass plot 
or flower bed or to maintain a path, or 
where it is banked against the front or 
sides of a recreation building in a narrow 
border. 

Vines on a trellis make an excellent cover 
to a sand bin, much cooler and more satis- 
factory than an awning. They will serve to 
conceal outbuildings, and may well be used 
to cover buildings of any sort. 


Grass and Flowers 


It is difficult to raise grass in a small 
playground because the children tread it 
down and kill it. The only grass I know 
of that will stand this intensive wear is the 
Bermuda grass of the South. Nevertheless, 
it may be quite possible to have a border 
of grass under the trees around the ground. 
This would add greatly to the appearance 
of the grounds and would serve as a place 
for story-telling and resting when weary 
from hard play. It may be necessary to 
protect this grass by a low wire fence or 
hedge so that the children may not use it 
as a part of their play field. Such a border 
should be maintained whenever it is pos- 
sible. 

Flowers and playgrounds do not go well

together, and any extensive decoration of 
a playground with flower beds is sure to be 
an intrusion and a nuisance. Some of the 
school playgrounds in Washington had 
flower beds situated next to the fences 
Many of these flower beds were practically 
uninjured by the play, and the playgrounds 
were certainly prettier for having the 
flowers; but the simple fact is that play- 
grounds were intended to raise children and 
not flowers, and where teachers put flow- 
ers above children, as has been done in 
many school yards, the children always 


playgrounds and gardening, as gardening is 
not play to most children. The gardening 
should be regarded as a form of manual 
training in the open air. There is a great 
lack of such handicrafts for boys in city 
playgrounds; no boy wants to play all the 
time, and almost any form of legitimate 
handicraft is worth while. Every child 
ought to know, as a part of his education, 
how plants grow and how the vegetables 
that he sees every day on the table look in 
the ground. 

The common practice has been to raise

suffer. If there is a flag. pole on the 
grounds, as there should be, it is well to 
have a mass of banked flowers, such as 
salvia or cannas or geraniums, about the 
flag pole; or it may be worth while to 
have one or two simple beds of flowers at 
the entrance to the ground, on each side of 
the gate, and kept by the attendant, but | 
doubt if much more than this is wise. 


Children’s Gardens 
This term is usually understood to mean 
the vegetable gardens that are a feature in 
so many playgrounds. There is no in- 
herent reason for the connection between 


four or five different kinds of vegetables, 
such as radishes, beets, lettuce, turnips, 
carrots and the like, in individual plots for 
which the individual child is responsible, 
and then perhaps to have some large ex- 
perimental plots on which various other 
things are raised. One of the most success- 
ful gardens of this kind is the one con- 
ducted by Mrs. Henry Parsons, of New 
York City, known as the International 
Farm School, and located in De Witt Clin 
ton Park at about Fiftieth Street and Tenth 
\venue. There is a tract about 150 feet 
square laid out to somewhat less than 400 
small gardens. The gardens are 4 by 8 feet

The Menagerie 

\ll children are fond of animals. It is 
the children who keep up the zoological 
gardens in all of our cities, for it is they 
and the parents they bring who are the 
chief visitors. In the state of Oregon the 
Superintendent of Schools promotes the 
idea that every child should have some ani- 
mal to care for. There are excellent rea- 
sons for this. The care of an animal gives 
a sense of responsibility which should al 
ways be encouraged. I do not feel sure 
how far it is safe to trust children to feed 
animals things that will not kill them, but 
certainly it adds greafly to the pleasure if

they may feed as well as watch them. In 
the zodlogical gardens of Germany there is 
food for sale which may be purchased and 
fed to the animals. A little pig is always 
interesting to children, and two or three 
chickens that might lay eggs and possibly 
hatch out a brood of little ones would be 
of endless interest. In the yard of the 
Emerson School in Gary, Ind., there is a 
coon house and tree. In the yard of the 
Froebel School there is a large fountain 
that is to be filled with fish. Many kinder- 
gartens have rabbits and guinea pigs and 
gold fish; so a menagerie is not altogether 
an innovation. 


Birds and Squirrels 


During the last decade the squirrels have

[hey have apparently found that the coun 
try is too dangerous, that the city is safer 
and that the high price of living is greatly 
reduced by the peanuts that are dispensed 
on the park bench and the bread lunches 
that are thrown down. Most playgrounds 
are now practically without trees of any 
considerable size, but we hope they will 
sometime have them. Children have not 
been very kind to birds and animals in the 
past, but they are gaining a new love 
through their nature study, and perhaps 
sometimes we can have bird and squirrel 
houses in the trees around the playground 
and call the birds and squirrels to make 
their home there. The playground seems 
really to require them for its completion 


























$235,591,350 Fire Loss in 1914 


Only three years—1go04 with the Baltimore fire, 1906 with the San 
Francisco fire, and 1908 with the Chelsea, Mass., conflagration—have 
shown a greater loss by fire in the U nited States and Canada than the year 
1914 with its enormous total of $235,591,350. The great Salem fire, which 
occurred in June, 1914, ea $13,000,000, but it was during the last two 
month of the year that the burning ratio increased phenomenally. There 
were during the year 46 fires a of which caused a property damage of 
at least half a million dollars. A comparison of the losses by months for 








the years 1912, 1913 and 1914 is given in_the following table from the

State governments are recognizing the necessity of legislation tending 
toward greater conservation, and in many states laws have been adopted 
establishing fire marshals with powers to investigate causes of fires and to 
suggest and enforce regulations resulting in their prevention. Investiga- 
tions by state commissions show that probably from 70 to &o per cent of 
the country’s fires are preventable. The legislative movement is yet too 
young to have had any appreciable effect upon the fire waste of the country 
as a whole. 











How a Chamber of Commerce Makes Children 


Factors in Fire Prevention 
By Roland B. Woodward 


Secretary, Rochester Chamber of Commerce, Rochester, N. Y. 


OCHESTER’S fire loss for 1914 _ their influence strongly felt to effect a re- 


is estimated as $454,000. In itself 
this is not remarkable. No doubt 
many other municipalities whose popula- 
tions equal Rochester's were more fortu- 
nate. Here is the significance of the Roch- 
ester situation, however. In 1910, fire de- 
stroyed approximately $800,000 worth of 
property in the Flower City; in 1904 more 
than $3,000,000 met the same fate. 
“Well,” you reason, and correctly, too, 
“some powerful factor for good, some con- 
certed, systematic effort must be making 


[142] 


duction of more than 40 per cent in the 
last four years. Rochester's fire prevention 
campaigns must be singularly well received 
by the public.” ‘ 

That last statement is the keynote of the 
success of most campaigns. It is true of 
Rochester, or the principles of fire preven- 
tion could never have been so widely dis- 
seminated in the city. This must be said 
out of fairness to the broad-minded na- 
ture of the codperation given the Fire Pre- 
vention Committee of the Rochester Cham-

ber of Commerce in its four annual “Clean- 
Up Weeks.” The first was inaugurated in 
I91I, the year after the city’s fire loss ap 
peared to be getting beyond the control ot 
her citizens. A material reduction was im- 
mediately noted. Had hostility developed, 
the loss of the year just ended would un 
doubtedly have been much larger. As it 
is, however, the already established public 
sentiment in Rochester favoring fire pre- 
vention will enable sicceeding ccemmittees 
to build upon the cumulative results of pre 
vious campaigns. 

lhis country’s most promising hope for 
salvation from a fire loss twenty years 
hence that would bankrupt it to-day, lies 
in “Young America.” The youngster mind 
is plastic and open to impressions. Intro 
duce him to fire prevention principles, and 
their steady growth in his code is not 
threatened with asphyxiation by a multi- 
plicity of other business troubles and re- 
sponsibilities which constantly besiege the 
adult. It is reasonable to suppose that upon 
his reaching maturity fire prevention will 
be almost as much of an instinct with him 
as self-preservation. 

Consequently, the Rochester Chamber's 
Fire Prevention Committee is promoting 
plans for the present which it believes will 
automatically and surely take care of the 
city’s future. Methods to gain this end for 
Rochester are of the following general 
nature: 

Children are made big factors in the 
Chamber’s fire prevention campaigns. They 


, 
are made to asstst in driving the subject 


home to the general publi The subj 
of fire prevention is kept constantly before 
the youngster in jus formative years 1s 


a result, the coming generation should be 
converted; not fempora) ty, Dut as ti ; 
oughly as it is possible to do under the 
circumstances. 

pe cifically, through the efforts of the 
Chamber, a committee of principals and 


gestive courses 


teachers has worked out sug 
in fire and accident prevention. Thess 
courses are included in the public school 


catalogue to invite a study and considera 


tion of them by the teacher leachers are 
expected to give such parts of the course 
only as they find it possible to give in and 
through other subjects. here is much 


in each of these courses,” is the preface o! 
the Board of Education, “that can be used 
to advantage in the work of hygiene and 
physiology. There are also other portions 
that can be used to advantage in languages 
and that will reenforce the work in civics 
lhe exact place which these will ultimately 
take in our course of study is not estab 
lished. The courses are presented rathe1 
as a study.” 

Principals and teachers have been quick 
to respond. At some schools bonfires are 
built on the playgrounds, the fire gong is 
sounded, and the pupils assemble outside to 
witness the manipulation of fire extinguish- 
ers; first, by a trained fireman and then 
by one of their own number, to demon- 
strate how easy it is. 

















A TYPICAL ROCHESTER DEMONSTRATION TO 1800 SCHOOLCHILDREN 
These children now realize their ability to put out a fire in its early stages with an ordinary hand chemical 
fire extinguisher 




















144 THE AMERICAN CITY 


The Training in One School 

Because of the large number of pupils, 
this work is probably productive of the 
most results at School 26 in Rochester. 
Approximately 1,800 pupils attend this 
school, and Col. Samuel P. Moulthrop, the 
principal, attempts by such methods to keep 
the subject of fire prevention constantly 
before his charges. The playground pho- 
tograph with this article was taken at his 
school, which is shown in the background. 
Eighteen hundred children filed out of the 
three-story school building into that pho- 
tograph. The time was less than three 
minutes, which speaks well for the Roch- 
ester system. 

The extinguishers used are those which 
the pupils are accustomed to see before 
them on the walls and in the corridors 
every day at school. Contests are arranged 
between the boys to determine who can ex- 


tinguish a fire in the shortest time. “It 
proved very interesting to the pupils,” Col. 
Moulthrop wrote the committee, “and 


taught them the use of the extinguisher, 
demonstrating their ability to douse a fire 
in two minutes’ time.” 

The fire drill at this school has been made 
particularly effective. When smoke is ac- 
cidentally forced through the ventilating 
apparatus into the corridors and rooms, the 
alarm is always sounded. In view of the 
fact that this smoke is not frequent, the 
calmness and order shown by the pupils 
in leaving the building in record time are 
remarkable. Col. Moulthrop declares that 
over 1,800 children have marched from the 
school in the short space of two minutes. 
Once it happened that the din of approach- 
ing fire apparatus was heard when smoke 
was accidentally issuing from the venti- 
lators. The opportunity was not lost and 
the clangor of the school alarm bell was 
soon heard. The equanimity of those 
youngsters and their orderly speed in leav- 
ing the building were not in the least ad- 
versely affected under this most trying test. 
By being marched out frequently when the 
fire department is passing, the children 
have become thoroughly accustomed to the 
noise of the department on the run. 


The Yearly Clean-Up 
Then comes “Clean-Up Week” of the 
Fire Prevention Committee. We never fail 
to link up this seven-day campaign with 
the school work. It always tends to crys- 


tallize the study ideas in the child’s mind.

REPORT BLANK FOR ROCHESTER’S CLEAN-UP 


The entire city is divided into sections to 
be inspected. The downtown territory is 
taken care of by joint teams of the Fire 
Prevention and Public Health Commi‘ ees 
of the Chamber. The outlying and resi- 
dential sections are covered by Boy Scouts 
and other school children. They, however, 
do not enter premises, nor do they admon- 
ish tenants, but advise the committee of 
particularly bad cases. The special report 
blank furnished for this purpose by the 
Chamber is herewith reproduced. The 
children’s reports and the recommendations 
of the Chamber's two committees are 
brought to the attention of the city Fire 
Marshal or the Health Bureau. Both of 
these departments codperate with the 
Chamber in its campaigns. A reinspection 
of the city last fall (“Clean-Up Week” 
occurred last spring) showed material im- 
provement and conscientious adoption of 
our recommendations. 

Success along these lines depends to a 
large extent upon the volume and ardor 
of public sentiment favorable to fire pre- 
vention. In Rochester this might be meas- 
ured by the amount of rubbish handled at 
the public incinerator during the cam- 
paigns. The fact that it has been treble 
the amount of ordinary weeks showed the 











SOI litte se. 





THE AMERICAN CITY 145 


public’s willingness to codperate. In 
Clean-Up Week of 1913, 303,350 pounds, 
or 1,629 cubic yards, of rubbish were col- 
lected and disposed of at the incinerator. 
During the 1914 Clean-Up Week there 
was an increase of 50 per cent over last 
year’s figures. Despite the fact that the 
force of employes was doubled, Clean-Up 
Week raised enough dirt this year to keep 
the plant rushed at top speed for the fol- 
lowing three weeks without discharging 
the extra help. Not that the city was par- 
ticularly dirty; in fact, the committee in- 
spéctors reported’ it to be but twenty per 
cent in need of the broom. 

In conclusion, a few words should be 
written in commendation of the support 
given the Chamber by the city administra- 
tion. Under the efficient direction of Fire 
Chief Charles Little, our fire fighters reach 
a fire in the business section about two min- 
utes after the alarm is received, and in the 
residence section from three-to four min- 
utes. It is evident to the most critical that 
the city of Rochester is doing its duty with 


and through the Fire Department By 
commonly accepted standards this is 
enough. Due to the broad-minded policy 
of Mayor Hiram H. Edgerton, however, 
the city of Rochester has outdone its 
“duty” by openly and publicly encouraging 
citizens to codperate with the Chamber. 
Charles S. Owen, former Commissioner of 
Public Safety, who resigned January 1, 
1915, to assume the duties of the Sheriff's 
office to which he was recently elected, has 
always been a sympathetic and hard-work- 
ing ally in the Chamber’s fire prevention 
campaigns. The same is true of Fire Mar 
shal Edward Wheeler, Jr., who was a mem- 
ber of the 1914 Fire Prevention Commit 
tee. The effectiveness of the campaign just 
closed is largely attributable to his gracious 
adoption of the Chamber’s recommenda- 
tions in cases in need of remedy. 

Under such circumstances and with such 
willing codperation from the Board of Edu- 
cation, Rochester’s already small fire loss 
should decrease despite the inevitable in 
crease in the city’s population. 





Duluth’s Fire-Fighting Trolley Car 


By George D. McCarthy 


Assistant Secretary, Commercial Club of Duluth 


ULUTH, Minnesota, has a trolley car 
D as a part of the equipment of its fire 
department. An unusual condition 

was responsible for the “partial trolleyiza- 
tion” of the Duluth fire-fighting equipment. 
Even though similar conditions may not ob- 
tain, some other cities might find it advan- 
tageous to follow Duluth’s lead in fire pro- 
tection for detached suburbs where poor 

















roads or other barriers prevent ready re- 
sponse by motor or horse equipment to 
alarms of fire. 

The harbor of Duluth is formed by a 
narrow strip of land extending across the 
western end of Lake Superior. This strip 
of land, only four to six hundred feet in 
width, extends for a distance of seven miles 
from the Minnesota to the Wisconsin shore 
\bout three miles of it, extending from the 
Duluth shore, is built up. Many of the cot 
tages are merely summer homes, but others 
are permanent residences of comparatively 
expensive construction. 

The settled portion of Park Point, as the 
suburb is called, is cut off from the city 
proper by the entrance to the harbor, 
spanned by an aerial bridge. Crossing the 
bridge is sometimes a slow process—slow 
compared with the dispatch necessary in 
response to a fire alarm. But that is not the 
main obstacle to reaching the houses on 
Park Point with fire-fighting apparatus 
The suburb is so narrow that only one street 
is laid out. The car tracks are laid in that

Sweeping City Streets by Machine 


By Frank Hagerdorn 


Superintendent of Streets, Litchfield, Ill. 


UR experience in passing from the 
use Of brooms and brushes to ma- 
chine sweeping for street cleaning, 

is probably very similar to that of all other 
cities and towns, 

After years of mud streets, followed by 
the application of macadam to a few blocks 
where traffic was heaviest, our people de- 
cided to build, in the business district, a 
number of blocks of brick pavement. Two 
adininistrations pushed the building of 
pavements, both adopting the two-course, 
sand-filled plan. The pavement was such an 
improvement in the elimination of Illinois 
mud that a long time passed before our peo- 
ple realized that street litter and dirt should 
be regularly removed; for a number of 
years after our main business and residence 
streets were paved with brick, our people 
were entirely satisfied with a general clean- 
up in the spring and fall, the accumulation 
of dirt being removed by the use of shovels 
and push brooms, 

Two or three years ago our Merchants’ 
Association and others occupying the busi- 
ness district tried to induce the city authori- 
ties to clean the streets in the business dis- 
trict regularly, and succeeded to the extent 





that men with push brooms, scoop shovels 
and wheelbarrows were put to work. This 
plan proved so expensive and unsatisfactory 
that it was discontinued after a short trial 
later the Merchants’ Association purchased 
a Menzies hand sweeping outfit, which en 
abled one man with a push broom to keep 
eight blocks of brick, sand-filled pavement 
in proper condition; the pavement in the 
district I have in mind would average over 
thirty feet in width with three blocks sev- 
enty-five feet wide. 

With the increased use of automobiles 
the dust nuisance in the residence district 
was increased to such an extent that the 
people began to complain of the condition 
of the paved streets, and, as hand sweeping 
was out of the question on account of its 
cost, the City Council, after a thorough in- 
vestigation, purchased a Twentieth Century 
Pick-up sweeper from the Baker Manufac- 
turing Company, Springfield, IIl. 

Taking into consideration the small 
amount of water required where this 
sweeper is used, the consequent reduced ex- 
pense for sprinkling, and the fact that the 
machine deposits the sweepings so that they

can be conveniently loaded for removal, we 
find that our street cleaning costs less than 
half of the cost of hand work, using push 
brooms or brushes. 

Our paving is all brick, filled between 
courses with sand, and flushing is out of the 
question, not only on account of the con- 
struction of our pavement, but for the rea- 
son that we have not a sufficient supply of 


water and our sewers have not fall enough 
to carry away heavy refuse. 

By keeping our pavement in good condi- 
tion and taking advantage of every oppor- 
tunity to use the sweeper immediately fol- 
lowing rains, we expect to clean all the 
pavement in the city at an expense not to 
exceed the amount heretofore paid for 
hand work in the business district alone.

Park Work for Unemployed 


To help the unemployed during the cold 
weather and hard times—and incidentally 
to help the appearance of the parks—the 
Public Park Commission of Lynn, Mass., is 
paying $2.50 a day for the cutting down 
of dead trees in the Lynn public park. The 
city appropriated $10,000 to be used for this 
purpose, and the public generally are being 
asked to contribute to the fund. It is hoped 
that the citizens’ fund alone may amount to 
$15,000. In addition, the money from the 
sale of the wood will be used to keep the 
men at work until their regular occupations 
can be taken up again.

Prize Contest—Plans for Working- 
men’s Homes 


To stimulate interest in the housing of 
unskilled workers in Los Angeles, the Los 
Angeles Housing Commission offers prizes 
ranging from $50 to $10 for the best de- 
signs submitted before noon on March 11, 
1915, in accordance with specified condi- 
tions. The hypothetical case is taken of an 
owner with two plots of land to be devel- 
oped. On this land four types of houses 
of varying cost are to be erected, with a 
fixed maximum of dwellings of any one type 
which will be permitted. The houses must 
be for individual families, but on the 
smaller of the plots four such houses may 
be included under one roof. It is specified 
that. the houses be arranged on the land so 
that éach house shall be given proper air, 
light, ventilation, privacy and its own yard 
and entrance, that the land and premises 
about the houses shall be well drained, shall 
have paved walks, and yards and lawn 
spaces, and shall be so arranged that each 
house shall have its individual flower gar- 
den. The buildings may be of wood or 
masonry, with rooms of certain sizes, well 
arranged for privacy and convenience, well 
lighted, well ventilated, with plain plastered 
walls and ceilings and wood floors, and very 
plain and simple finish, fittings and fixtures. 


[152] 


The exteriors of the houses must have in- 
dividuality and must provide sufficient vari- 
ation to relieve monotony. Specifications 
material and an estimate of cost 
must accompany the plans. The Commis- 
sion reserves the right to place upon ex- 
hibition all the drawings submitted, and to 
retain permanently drawings to which prizes 
have been awarded. Further details may 
be obtained by addressing the Los Angeles 
Housing Commission, City Hall, Los An- 
geles, Cal.

Health Department and Public 
Library Cooperate 

One of the measures adopted by Wash- 
ington, D. C., in looking after the health of 
its babies, involves an interesting form of 
cooperation between the health department 
and the public library. A practical and 
compact little pamphlet entitled “How to 
Keep Your Baby Well” is sent out by the 
health department to each mother upon the 
report of the birth of her child. In a sec- 
ond edition of this pamphlet which has re- 
cently been issued there appears a section 
on “Books that Mothers Ought to Know,” 
in which mothers are told that they can ob- 
tain at the library the best books on the care 
of babies. It is stated that the library has 
many copies of books of this kind which 
may be horrowed entirely free of charge, 
and some of the standard volumes are men- 
tioned. The requirements for taking out a 
library card are also made simple by means 
of a few practical instructions. Might not 
this method of calling attention to the li- 
brary ’s resources at just the opportune mo- 
ment be more widely made use of?

Policemen Told How to Keep Well 
A policeman’s work is such that at any 
moment his life or the life of others may 
depend upon his being in good physical con- 
dition. The good health of the men also 
saves druggists’ bills, helps their rating in 
the department, and contributes to pro- 
longed life, With these facts in mind, po-

THE AMERICAN CITY 


lice surgeons of New York City, with the 
aid of Dr. S. S, Goldwater, Commissioner 
of Health, have prepared a booklet of ad- 
vice to policemen on “How to Keep Well,” 
and Police Commissioner Arthur Woods 
has had the booklet distributed among mem- 
bers of the department. The advice given 
covers the ordinary matters of exercise and 
eating, taking precautions against becom 
ing infected—for example, with tubercu- 
losis or with the bites of dogs or prisoners— 
conveying disease to others, wearing arch 
supports, etc. By calling the attention of 
members of the force to these simple rules, 
it is hoped to prevent many ailments com- 
mon to police duty, and thereby not only to 
increase the efficiency of the department, 
but to contribute to the welfare of both the 
men and their families.

Books on Housing 


The Civics Extension Committee of Chi-

copy of a list of books on housing in the 
Chicago Library. The secretary of the 
committee is Edward L. Burchard, Room 
got, 116 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago,

Monthly Meetings of the San Diego 
Department of Water 


The Department of Water, of San Diego, 
Cal., has during the last two winters been 
holding an interesting series of evening 
meetings in the Council Chamber. These 
meetings were inaugurated by the Super- 
intendent, Herbert R. Fay, and are held 
monthly. They are for the benefit of the 
department as a whole, and particularly for 
the purpose of bringing all the officials and 
foremen of the department into closer 
touch with each other. 

At the December meeting a valuable 
paper was submitted by Max Weston, head 
of the department's division of lands. Mr. 
Weston’s paper took the form of recom- 
mendations for the development of the 
pueblo lands owned by the city of San 
Diego. A new water system to make pos- 
sible the use of part-of these lands for 
residential purposes, and thie use of a large 


tract for social welfare institutions, some- 
what along the lines of the Cooley farms 
of Cleveland, were recommended. It was 
also suggested that in the development 
work the relief of unemployment be def 
initely recognized as a fixed policy of the 
city.

Lily Bulbs for School Children 


Chattanooga, Tenn., bids fair to become 
a flowering garden of lilies if all the bulbs 
given away by Mr. E. A. Abbott, a kind- 
hearted citizen with a love for the city beau- 
tiful, come up successfully. Last October 
Mr. Abbott issued through the press an en- 
ticing invitation to “Girls and Boys Who 
Go to School,” which stated that on Satur- 
day morning between eight and nine o'clock, 
a hundred bags, each containing five roots 
of iris of different colors dug out of his 
own garden, and “as like as not” some lemon 
(yellow) lilies, would be given to the first 
hundred children who should come to claim 
them. Iris was chosen for the undertaking 
because it is easy to grow, is strikingly 
beautiful, and multiplies rapidly. Each child 
was asked to bring a letter stating what 
school he attended and where he lived, and 
promising to plant the roots carefully and 
tend them until they should be big plants. 

In spite of a pouring rain, half again as 
many children as were invited called early 
Saturday morning. Each was rewarded 
with a bag containing five iris roots and 
two lemon lily bulbs, and was given direc- 
tions how to plant them. The same invi- 
tation, issued a second time, met with an 
equally enthusiastic response. On both oc- 
casions, however, only white children came. 
Mr. Abbott then decided to provide a treat 
for the little colored folk alone. “The ob 
ligation to beautify,” said his letter to the 
colored children, “falls with equal weight 
on all classes of our people. A city can 
make civic progress only through the efforts 
of all its citizens. The codperation of the 
colored people is needed in this matter, and 
[ am sure they will not disappoint us.” 

To the white and colored children to- 
gether a total of 4,200 iris roots and 1,000 
lemon lily bulbs were distributed. Because 
of the enthusiasm with which the children 
have responded to his invitations, Mr. Ab- 
bott plans to try the venture again next fall 
with 10,000 plants.

showing the number of street accidents due 
to surface cars in the city of New York for 
September, October, November and Decem- 
her, 1914, in comparison with the same 
months of 1913. The figures are especially 
significant because of the fact that the near- 
side stop ordinance in New York went into 
effect on September 1, 1914. Additional in- 
stallations of air brakes also added to the 
favorable showing made by the last four 
months of 1914. The totals are as follows: 


During the first month under the new 
plan there was an increase in accidents to 
persons boarding cars. This was due to un- 
familiarity with the new system. These ac- 
cidents decreased when the public learned 
to board cars on the near side. With this 
one exception, there was a decrease in every 
kind of accident due to surface car opera- 
tion for each of the four months as com- 
pared with the corresponding month of the 
previous year. 





Relative Size of Municipal Police Departments 


Compiled by Andrew Linn Bostwick 
Municipal Reference Librarian, St. Louis Public Library 


HIS table attempts to compare the po- 
lice forces of the largest cities as to 
size only. It does not purport to 

draw any conclusions as to the efficiency of 
the departments, or any other similar ques- 
tion. It should be borne in mind that tables 
of this sort are useful only in giving a gen- 
eral idea of the subject. To make a more 
exact comparison of the sizes of police 
forces it would be necessary to conduct a 
most exhaustive study and consider a great 


many factors not reckoned with here. 

The information in the tables is prac- 
tically all up-to-date. The statistics as to 
street mileage and number of patrolmen 
are taken from letters received from official , 
sources in December, 1914. The popula- 
tion figures are those given by the Census 
Bureau as estimates for 1914; the figures 
as to area of cities are taken from the 
World Almanac, which in turn received the 
information direct from the municipalities.

t Shows the average number of patrolmen working at a given time, on beat duty or otherwise. Each 
city has its own way of dividing its force into two or three platoons, and the systems vary so greatly that 
in making a general comparison the simplest procedure is to divide the total number of patrolmen by the 
number of platoons and compare the results thus obtained.

Rebuilding Belgian Cities 

The International Garden Cities and 
and Town Planning Association has set on 
foot a project for the application of the 
principles of the garden city movement t 
the rebuilding of Belgium after the war 

It is proposed at once to initiate an edu 
cational campaign among the general mass 
of Belgian public now in England and par- 
ticularly to educate Belgian architects. The 
first conference is to be held in London, 
February 11-15. Speeches will be made by 
representatives of the British and Belgian 
governments, and visits will be paid to 
various garden city and garden suburb 
schemes in England. Coincident with the 
conference will be an exhibition of ns, 
etc., dealing largely with Belgium and the 
application of town planning to Belgian 
cities. 

The International Garden Cities & Town 
Planning Associaticn has started on a great 
work which will require large funds. It is 
hoped that persons interested in proper town 
development will recognize the service 
which it is attempted to render to distressed 
Belgium, and give it financial support. Con 
tributions may be sent to Ewart G. Culpin, 
Secretary, 3 Gray's Inn Place, London,

of the unexpectedly large number, the dis-

College Avenue, Grand Rapids, Michigan. Lewis Road Tar Pavement. 


Money Saved is Money Earned 


The principal objection against the improvement of city streets and 
country roads is their first cost and maintenance—everyone favors 
well paved streets but they fear the initial expense and upkeep 

Lewis Road Tar Macadam solves this problem for the city officials 
and county engineers. The cost is small, the maintenance is very little 
and you get all the benefits derived from high priced pavements. 
Fully ninety per cent of all streets and roads could be paved with 
LEWIS ROAD TAR MACADAM at about one-half the expense 


of the average cost of high priced pavements, with the same results. 
Dustiess, Noiseless, Durable, Permanent, Satisfactory 


Aside from this one of the strongest points in this direction 
being that its surface offers least liability for horses slipping 
or automobile skidding. Write us for further information,

the majority of cases. 

At the afternoon session the necessity for 
a housing law was clearly pointed out, a 
housing law rather than a tenement-house 
law which could be regarded only as a half- 
way measure in communities not yet fully 
educated. 

At the evening session even Boston ad 
mitted that there are types of houses pref- 
erable to the three-deckers, but divided as 
to the possibility of getting one- and two 
family houses near its center. Floor plans 
which will provide for light and ventilation 
in every room, and for privacy, and policies

As the importance of equipment increases, the prob 
lem of how to carry cut a given plan of construction 
becomes more complex, and it is of vast consequence 
to apply to its solution a knowledge of the relative cost 
and efhciency of different methods and materials. Mr 

Dana’s volume, of convenient handbook size. gives the 

information. most necessary to engineers in making 

estimates of construction cost and in executing plans

the book. An appendix gives lists of the principal 
manufacturers of the equipment described.

Immigration discussed from the standpoint of one 
who has been an immigrant. The question is taken up 
on moral grounds, the plea being made for strict loy- 
alty to the principles of freedom expressed in the 
Declaration of Independence. A particularly appealing 
section is that describing the strength, patience, ideal 
ism and progressiveness of the aliens and their use

It is the author’s conviction “that the play of school 
Idren is a school problem,” and “that no other city 
lepartment can deal with it satisfactorily.” In this 
volume, accordingly, he discusses play not only in the 
nary sense of children’s play, b ludes athleti 
secondary schools and colleges, recreation at sun 
mer schools and camps and school social centers, and 
* training of play teachers. Chapters entitled ““What 
Play?” “Play as Physical Training,” “‘Play and the 
rraining of the Intellect,” “Play and the Formation of 
Habits of Character,” form an introduction to the 
main body of the book, which in addition to the sul 
jects mentioned, takes up the question of play as 
treated in the German and English schools, the layout, 
equipment and organization of school playgrounds ir 
American cities, play at the rural school, the play-

Shower Mixer 


This device obviates the loss of time and the 
necessity of operating different valves until the 
right temperature of water is secured. With the 
Ingham the bather has perfect control over the

stantly water of the desired temperature is obtained. 
This temperature remains fixed until position of 
indicator handle is changed. 

The Ingham Shower Mixer prevents waste of 
water, heat and fuel. Makes scalding impossi- 
ble. Increases the capacity of every shower by 
automatic, self-cleaning. 
. Requires no repairs and adjustments. Costs less 
{ to maintain and operate than any other shower

and seeing the importance of reducing its cost 
so as to compete with good wood construc-

cooperation of the National Fire Proofing 
Company, a new hollow tile with a pleasing 
exterior surface, something like tapestry brick, 
warm red in color, at one-third its cost. This 
tile makes of itself the permanent wall with- 
out the cost of the expensive stucco. The unit 
of tile—6 by 12 inches face by 6 to 8 inches 
thick, with double air spaces-—will, where 
properly laid with Portland cemerit, make an 
impervious masonry wall, warm in winter and 
cool in summer.

Ordinary solid rubber tires do more 
damage to the apparatus than the tires 
themselves are worth. This has greatly 
reduced the safe speed of some fire 
trucks. 

But Goodyear makes a dual Cushion 
tire that is built for high speed and great 
resiliency. Patented features reduce 
vibration to a minimum. This saves 
the apparatus from tremendous shocks, 
yet gives a high tire mileage. 

The All-Weather tread is the ideal 
pneumatic tire for use on Chiefs’ cars or

The Lungmotor as a Life-Saver 
Among the mechanical respirators used in 
the subway fire in New York last month, th« 
Lungmotor played an important part. By a 
fortunate coincidence a New York represen 
tative of the Life Saving Devices Company of 
Chicago happened to pass the immediate vicin 
ity of the accident with two Lungmotors, just 
is some of the victims were being hauled out 
of the subway to the street surface. The 
Lungmotors were promptly put into use and 
others were secured from the company’s office 
and from hospitals. In sesuscitating persons 
who had been overcome with the fumes in the 
subway, it is said that eight of these hand- 
operated breathing devices were successfully 
used by men who had never seen one before; 
thus showing the availability of the Lungmotor 
even in the absence of a trained operator.

Gasoline Lamps 


An attractive little calendar for 1915 has 
been issued by The Coleman Lamp Company, 
of Wichita, Kan., with a colored picture called 

‘Air-O-Lite Comfort,” which gives a pleasing 
home scene in the glow of one of the Coleman 
lamps. The company is also distributing a 
large circular describing a number of lighting 
units of its manufacture. These are claimed 
to furnish gasoline lighting perfected. The 
circular shows types for the home, church, 
store and street, with 25 clear illustrations. 
One of the company’s specialties is the in- 
stalling of lighting systems for parks and 


streets.

For Aid in Tree Surgery 


“Tree Tanglefoot,” manufactured by the 

& W. Thum Company, of Grand Rapids, 
Mich., is recommended for waterproofing the 
crotch of a tree or a cavity or wound in a 
tree, when other applications have failed. It is 
applied only after all decayed wood and loose 
particles of dirt have been removed and the 
cavity or wound thoroughly dried. The af-

fected parts can be easily removed with a 
hammer and a chisel; almost anyone exercising 
reasonable care can ‘do the work. Tanglefoot 
is also used for the treatment of trees after 
trimming or pruning. It never hardens; hence 
there is no cracking, and the substance always 


AND MANUFACTURERS 175 


remains pliable. One application lasts for 
years, and is impervious to air and water. It 
is said that if prompt attention is given to trees 
and the girdled surface is coated with Tre 
Canglefoot, the trees will suffer no serious 
setback and new bark will gradually form, 
eventually covering the girdled surface.

Dust Prevention in Newport, R. I. 


Frequent cleaning of streets is the best dust 
preventive, — to the Street Department 
of Newport, R. L., which, during 1913, cleaned 
3,420 miles of bale about 53,853,304 square 
yards—at a cost of $29,741. These streets were 
sprinkled, from May 1 to November 27, with 
salt and fresh water, and the principal ones with 
“Dustoline.” On an average 52 miles of streets 
were watered twice daily at about $184 per 
mile. For seven years the Highway Depart- 
ment has applied “Dustoline” to the roadbeds 
of certain streets. Last year 35 miles of road 
bed, of an average width of 20 feet, was treated 
at a cost of about $115 per mile. “Dustoline” 
was applied from one to four times during the 
season, and 45,132 gallons were purchased at 
about 8% cents per gallon. Most of the streets 
in Newport are macadam or _ bituminous 
macadam.

Protecting Steam Boilers 

Copies of a booklet on “Steam Boilers and 
Boiler Feed Water,” prepared by the American 
Boiler Life Company, of Boston, are being 
circulated by the American Steam Gauge & 
Valve Manufacturing Company, of that city 
The booklet shows the destructive effect upon 
boilers of solids and gases conti ained in even 
the purest water. It is claimed that a metal 
preservative has been discovered (known as 
“American Boiler Life”) which will protect 
the heating surfaces by neutralizing destruc- 
tive substances, overcoming gases and by 
forming a thin film over the metal. In old 
boilers it gradually removes the scale and 
then forms the protecting film. It does not 
follow the steam, we are told, and is free from 
acid and odors, and may therefore be used 
without fear by plants which use live steam 
or water direct from boilers; it counteracts 
the action of oil by changing its physical con- 
dition to that of a fluid, which readily circu- 
lates with the water, and is therefore blown 
off. One quart of “American Boiler Life” is 
used with every 7,500 gallons of water evapo 
rated. It may be fed into the pump, feed 
water tank or hot wells.

A Saving in Road Making 


ox shale used alone is unfit for service on 
a country road, to say nothing of a city street, 
for it antes up into a sticky mud whi ch is al- 
most impassable in winter time. Laboratory 
tests, however, showed so convincingly that a 


good road could be made with shale when 
treated with Glutrin, that the authorities of 
Princeton University built in this manner in 
the summer of 1913 a road leading over to 
Graduate Hall. This gave such excellent ser- 
vice that the city engineer of Princeton decided 
to build Linden Lane in like manner, as it 
would mean a great saving in cost, the shal 
being near at hand and much ae r than the 
local stone. A photograph of Linden Lane is 
shown on this page 

Every engineer strives to get good results 
at the lowest cost, and, while a potent factor 
in low costs is the use of local material, unfor 
tunately in many instances such use cannot be 
made on account of traffic requirements; it is 
therefore worth noting that red shale, which 
is plentiful and cheap in various parts of th« 
United States, can be used with Glutrin 09 be a 
promise of satisfactory service. This bind

“Common-Sense Comments 
Concerning Culverts” 

This is the title of a 16-page illustrated 
booklet prepared by the publicity department 
of the United States Cast Iron Pipe & Foundry

following questions : 


What is a culvert and why used? 
What are the requirements for a good culvert? 


What are the characteristics of the various types? 


It sets forth the merits of cast iron culverts,

It Is Possible 


to utilize an ordinary 
street railway pole in 
connection with orna- 
mental bases and 
brackets to support 
either Mazda lamps 
or inverted luminous 
arc lamps. 












You can string 
your wires along the 
top of the poles, where 
they are practically 
unnoticeable and 
out of the way of 


traffic. 





You save the cost 
of additional lamp 
standards and under- 
ground construction, 
and avoid further ob- 
struction of the curb

MORRIS LIGHTING STANDARDS

VER thirty years of far-reaching experience, 
original ideas and correct theories, zealously 
applied, have crystallized as Morris traditions and have 
stamped our lighting standards as “‘ideal”’ for 

all systems of outdoor lighting. 


RT plus utility, that much sought-after combina- 
tion, is embodied in al! Morris Ornamental Light- 


+ ing Standards. Both of these phases have been symmetrically 


developed: in more than 500 design

( NLY the highest grade of chemically analyzed pig iron is em- 
ployed in the manufacture of Morris Ornamental Standards. 
This means that they possess all the corrosion-resisting elements inherently 
characteristic of cast-iron, making them entirely rust proof—weather proof.

constantly growing favor of Morris Standards. (See last month’s American City

LIGHT UP 


BUT DO IT 


THE RIGHT WAY 


HE appearance of ornamental lighting is 

often ruined by the use of the wrong kind 

of glassware. Ordinary glass balls, which 
in the daytime carry out the symmetry of an 
ornamental! column—at night become ridiculously 
small splotches of light, like this 





USE POLYCASE GLASS 


REGISTERED 
and you will have 


UNIFORMLY LUMINOUS 


BALLS OF LIGHT 
Like this 





When POLYCASE balls are used the glass 
itself becomes the source of light, owing to the 
remarkable diffusing qualities of this glassware. 
In addition POLYCASE absorbs very little 
light.

THE SERVICES OF THE 
AMERICAN CITY BUREAU 


These services have been designed to develop strong, efficient result-producing 
commercial organizations in the shortest possible time and at the lowest expense. 
They include more than a campaign for members and income. They begin by 


Creating the Right Community Spirit 





DISTINCTIVE feature of the work undertaken by this Bureau is 

the spirit that underlies it. We do not build our campaigns on the 
“factory boosting’ idea. Our plan of action includes preparation for 
securing additional industries—but it includes a great deal more. We 
have a record of results—permanent results—to prove that we are building 
on the right basis. Needless to say, one important step towards establish 
ing a commercial organization on a strong foundation, is 


Securing Adequate Income 





ERE also our record of “things done’’ shows that our efforts have 
been strikingly successful. This record is one that can be easily 
traced. We are ready and anxious to offer every assistance to anyone who 
is interested in determining whether the things we have accomplished have 
been lastingly satisfactory. 
After the campaign is completed, the actual life work of the organiza- 
tion commences. Any of the organizations with whom we have worked 
can tell you of our success in 


Making the Outgo Effective 


HE fact that Lucius E. Wilson, Campaign Director of this Bureau, 

has been secretary of two of the strongest commercial bodies in this 
country is peculiarly important in this connection. Mr. Wilson held this, 
position successively with the Greater Des Moines Committee and with 
the Detroit Board of Commerce. His work in these positions has given 
him an exceptional grasp of the practical operation of commercial bodies. 
The other members of our staff can also point to well established records of 
work well done. 





All of these subjects are dealt with more fully in a recent pamphlet. This pam- 
phlet contains information that will be of interest to all who are interested in the 
development of commercial organizations. Won’t you ask us to send you a copy’

The Telephone Unites the Nation 











\ t j 
\ & LS 
Sy 
TATED © 


PY this time, our country looms 
large on the world horizon as an 
example of the popular faith in the 
underlying principles of the republic. 


We are truly one people in all that 
the forefathers, in their most exalted 
moments, meant by that phrase. 


In making us a homogeneous peo- 
ple, the railroad, the telegraph and 
the telephone have been important 
factors. They have facilitated commu- 
nication and intervisiting, bringing us 
closer together, giving us a better 
understanding and promoting more 
intimate relations. 


The telephone has played its part 
as the situation has required. That it 
should have been planned for its 


present usefulness is as wonderful as 





that the vision of the forefathers should 
have beheld the nation as it is today. 


At first, the telephone was the voice 
of the community. As the population 
increased and its interests grew more 
varied, the larger task of the telephone 
was to connect the communities and 
keep all the people in touch, regard- 
less of local conditions or distance. 


The need that the service should be 
universal was just as great as that 
there should be a common language. 


This need defined the duty of the 
Bell System. 


Inspired by this need and repeat- 
edly aided by new inventions and 
improvements, the Bell System has 
become the welder of the nation. It 
has made the continent a community.

“Fverwear Stands Wear and Tear” 





“EVERWEAR” Roller Bearing Clamps are for mounting swings, 
flying and traveling rings—built to clamp on 2”, 214”, 3”, 4”, 5”, and 6” 
pipe. Simple but clever—correct in design and construction. _ 

We give you an “inside” view. As the load sets this in motion and 
it swings back and forth, you notice what happens to the clamp? The 
: bearings ROLL—they obviate friction 
they increase the enjoyment of the device 
and prolong the life of “ Everwear”’ 
apparatus. This is just one of our so- 
called “little things’? to which we have 
given careful*atten- 
tion like all the 
others. Prices if you 
ask for them. 


















‘*-sliding down our cellar door” 


SLIDE CHUTES 


The old cellar door is here commercialized and brought up to date. Children will 
climb and slide somewhere, somehow, and we here offer a device that is complete in de- 
tail and consistent with safety. 

Stairs are equipped with perforated steel treads, and handrails run the full length 
of stairs. Oceans of fun, and action is continuous. Fully described in Catalog C-3 
which will be sent on application.

All of these trees we have in large quantities and 
of the finest quality obtainable. 

Our trees are several times transplanted to secure 
an abundance of fibrous roots—one of the most 
essential features in a “‘ good tree.” 

Our trees are grown with straight stems—abso- 
lutely mecessary for their proper alignment on a 
street or boulevard. 

Our trees have well developed, symmetrical heads, 
showing uniformity when planted in a row. 

Prices are right for the character and quality of 
the stocks we offer.

CITY AND PARK TREES 


The trees of our cities and parks are becoming beautifully less from lack of care and attention, note 
the broken limbs and dead wood that strew the ground after a storm. 

I can remedy this condition by making an inspection, and furnishing experienced men to carry out 
the necessary work, or furnish directions from which local men can do the same.

THE AMERICAN CITY 














This is the brick being laid almost exclusively in Baltimore City, 
where every street and alley is being repaved. 


Toronto specifies it exclusively for brick pavements. 


Cincinnati specifications say: 


“ Wire-Cut-Lug Brick preferred.” 


New York State Highway Department is using Wire-Cut-Lug 
on the great Lake Shore road construction, six miles long. 


After three months of thorough investigation, Sears, Roebuck &’ 


Co., of Chicago, have paved the streets adjacent to their immense 
p'ant and huge buildings with Wire-Cut Lug Brick. 


Twenty-five independent competing companies make Wire-Cut- 


Lug Brick.

and makes possible the best of 
resurfacing and grading at the 


lowest possible cost. Efficient and 
economical in operation. 


The “Offset Engine Pole” 
By setting the pole at any desired 
angle, the grader will travel offset 
at either side of the path of the 
machine. Two or three graders 
may be worked with a single engine 
by placing each grader a littl 
ahead of the other and offset at 
various distances or on opposite 
sides with the engine in the centet 


Materials Used in Construction

The Standard Pavement 











Not the first five years 
but after that 


is the important consideration 
in the life of a pavement 





-Almost any asphalt may build a five-year pavement, 
although many manufactured-asphalt pavements go to 
pieces in less time than that. 

The profit to the community—to the taxpayer—is in 
the life of a pavement beyond the guarantee period. 

If the contractor builds a pavement that lasts out the 
guarantee period, that is all that he has agreed to do. 

But the city and its taxpayers have the best of reasons 
for insisting upon the use of materials with which can be 
built the pavement of the longest possible life. 

The pavement that will give the most, and most satis- 
factory, service for every dollar expended. 


That pavement is Trinidad Lake Sheet Asphalt. 


Ask for “Evidence’’—a booklet containing records from 
thirty cities of millions of yards of Trinidad pavements 
that have given good service for twenty years or more.

THE SENSIBLE SYSTEM 


The fairest method of charging is on the basis of the water 
used. In some places it may be best to supplement this with a 
minimum charge or some payment to cover the cost to the de- 
partment of being ready to serve, whether service is actually 
rendered or not. But in the main a charge according to the 
umount used, which is practically universal in the case of gas 
and electricity, is equally applicable to water. Who would ex- 
pect the purveyor of milk or coal, or meat or flour, to charge 
: according to the number of stories in your home, or even the 
number of persons in your family?” 





“There is nothing more ridiculous and unfair in the whole 
} realm of charges by either public or privately owned business 
4 than the charge for water according to the number of faucets 
k or bathtubs and water-closets, or according to the size of the 


house, or other fanciful methods commonly used in unmetered 
places. Neither the burden upon the water department nor 
the benefit to the consumer from the use of water has any con- 
ceivable relation to any of these things. People do not take 
baths in proportion to the number of their bathtubs, nor do they 
use water in proportion to the frontage of their house or the 
number of its rooms.”’ 


| SENSE OR NONSENSE-WHICH?

metered? Why not look into this matter further? Our series 
of vitally interesting booklets on the water meter question may
