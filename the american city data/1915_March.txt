U. S. Cast Iron Pipe 


Because U. S. Cast Iron Pipe Culverts possess every advantage a culvert should have and 
are entirely free,of the various very other type of culvert 





disadvantages found in eve 
save Cast iron. 


They possess great mechanical strength to withstand all 
by the highway. 


They resist corrosion almost indefinitely—cast iron pipe laid 
in good condition and in use today. 


They have impermeable walls of suitable thickness 


They will better maintain alignment—no water seepage in th 


ment. 
They have the highest flow capacity of any type—the lowest { 
’ given diameter. 
he U. S. Cast Iron Culvert Pipe is complete when shipped and ready for use wl 
received—easily, cheaply and correctly installed by unskilled labor 
: From every standpoint—service, economy, convenience and durabilit U. § 
4 Cast Iron Pipe Culverts offer those advantages which are necessary to good roads.

December 7th,1914. 

American - La - France Pire Engine Co., 
Elmira,N. Y. 
Gentlemen: - 

I wieh to state to you that your Type # 12 
Triple Combination Pumping and Hose Motor Car worked 
beginning Thursday night November 12th for twenty-three 
hours and thirty-two minutes without ae stop. 

We had a bad lumber fire Thursday evening 
at 6 P.Li. and the car went in service at that time, 
worked until 5:32 P.li. Priday, November 13th, which I 
believe makes twenty-three hours and thirty-two minutes. 

The car never stopped till we were ready 
to go home and never missed a stroke. It supplied 
three lines during this time. We consider this very 
excellent work. 

After returning from the lumber fire on 
Prideay evening, the car went to another fire that same 
evening, and two the next day, and was ready for another 
twenty-three hours work after that. And confirming 
everything you have said about your triple the Chief and 
myself take great pride in having such an apparatus in 
our Department, as we feel when we take this apparatus 


to a fire we are sure to get good results at all times. 


Yours a A Mehler

IV here can you find a community that has 

adopted the meter system in a thorough manner 

and has ever abandoned it for other methods ? 

On the contrary, you find a steady and rapid 

increase in the percentage of taps that are 
metered in most of our cities. 


What Does This Prove? 


Does it not prove that you who live 

in unmetered or only partly metered 

cities, ought to do some additional 
thinking on the subject? 


We have an interesting series of booklets

The merits of the Lambert have made water-meter systems popular. 
All improvements which the tests of time and long service show to be requisite in a Perfect Water 
Meter, are embodied in the Lambert. A good article is always worth the price. 


ONE QUALITY AND ONE MODEL ONLY. 


Made in all sizes §” to 6” of the best bronze Composition throughout, fitted with Unbreakable re- 
inforced disc-pistons. 





We firmly believe in ‘‘The Survival of the Fittest.”’ 
Here are a few reasons for our belief: 


Cleveland, Ohio, in 1912, awarded its entire contract for Water Meters, in sizes 
5-8 inch to 6 inches inclusive, at a price several thousand dollars higher than that of 
the low bidder, to this Company. 
A differential in value based on quality of material used, on low cost of maintenance, on 
merit and general excellence of Lambert Meters ascertained in a practical way by service use during 
many long years, had fully demonstrated their “‘fitness to survive.’ 


A 6-inch Thomson Meter, No. 8217, was set June 1, 1890, at Fort Adams, R.I. The Newport 
Water Company, under date April 29, 1913, say concerning it: 
“In a period of nearly twenty-three years, this meter has worked continuously night and 
day, with only two periods of repairs, one in 1905 and one in 1913, with a total record of 59,715,950 
cubic feet of water.’ 


Three (3) 6-inch Thomson Meters set in December, 1902, at Kingsbridge Power Station, 
Interborough Rapid Transit Company, 216th Street and 9th Avenue, New York City, N. Y.,

High pressure spraying is plus spraying

300 Ibs. pressure completely atomizes 
the solution into a penetrating fog-like 
mist that seeks out and adheres to every 
particle of foliage. The atomization is so 
perfect that drops 
will not form on 
the leaf and fall off, 
wasting the solu- 
tion, and so little 
solution is required 
as to prevent any 
possibility of in- 
jury to the foliage. 
Besides, high pressure gives greater capacity 
for the same size nozzles, hence more rapid 
work and lessened cost of spraying. 

For municipal, park and large estate 
work, high pressure spraying is the only 
efficient and economical method. To reach 
the tops of shade trees with a penetrating 
mist, powerful force is required. For trees 
of ordinary height, regular spray nozzles 
are used. Where tall trees are to be sprayed 
“solid stream” nozzles are required which

AND HERE’S WHY: 


Great Durability, because of its 
solid homogeneous construction from 
specially-treated fibre, formed under 
pressure and made water, oil, acid, 
gas and chemical-proof. Will not 
break, corrode or decay. 


Great Efficiency, because of its 
dielectric and mechancial strength, 
complete insulating value, perfect 
water and gas tight joints, smooth 
bore, and fire-resisting quality. 


Great Economy, because it gives 
better and longer service than other 
conduits; because it weighs one-sixth 
as much—hence reduces trucking and 
freight charges 80 per cent and cuts 
down labor cost; because it can be 
laid by unskilled workmen; because 
it comes in longer sections yet costs no 
more; because it can be laid in a 
shallower trench, cutting down labor 
cost still further.

Creating a New Art 


At the Centennial Exhibition at 
Philadelphia, the exhibit of the Bell 
System consisted of two telephones 
capable of talking from one part of 
the room to another. 


Faint as the transmission of speech 
then was, it became at once the 
marvel of all the world, causing 
scientists, as well as laymen, to ex- 
claim with wonder. 


Starting with only these feeble in- 
struments, the Bell Company, by 
persistent study, incessant experimen- 
tation and the expenditure of immense 
sums of money, has created a new art, 
inventing, developing and perfecting; 
making improvements great and small 
in telephones, transmitter, lines,cables, 
switchboards and every other piece of 
apparatus and plant required for the 
transmission of speech. 


As the culmination of all this, the 
Bell exhibit at the Panama-Pacific 
Exposition marks the completion of 
a Trans-continental Telephone line 
three thousand four hundred miles 
long, joining the Atlantic and the 
Pacific and carry:ng the human voice 
instantly and distinctly between New 
York and Saa Francisco. 


This telephone line is part of the 
Bell System of twenty-one million 
miles of wire connecting nine million 


telephone stations located everywhere 
throughout the United States. 


Composing this System, are the 
American Telephone and Telegraph 
Company and Associated Companies, 
and connecting companies, giving to 
one hundred million people Universal 
Service unparalleled among the na- 
tions of the earth.

Editorial Comment 


Wide-Open or Alternate Specifications? 
How much discretion should be allowed 
to city departments to purchase patented 
articles or special-brand materials when 
other goods obtainable at lower prices 
might be used? By what means may a 
municipality most effectively protect itself 
against buying at prices too high to result 
in economy, or too low to secure quality ? 
THe AMERICAN City invites letters from 
its readers in reply to these important 
questions. The inquiry is suggested by a 
difference of opinion which has arisen in 
certain quarters over the approval of a con- 
tract early in February for completing the 
paving of Riverside Drive, New York City. 
The thoroughfare in question, carrying an 
extremely heavy traffic which includes a 
constant succession of heavy motor-buses, 
was paved in 1913 from 72d to 114th Street 
with a high grade of asphaltic concrete. 
The problem came up some months ago 
as to the type of pavement that should be 
used for the remainder of the drive from 
114th street to the viaduct beyond Grant’s 
Tomb. The Park Department, which has 
jurisdiction over the Drive, petitioned the 
Board of Estimate and Apportionment to 
be allowed to specify a pavement exactly 
the same as that laid from 72d to 114th 
Street. At the first hearing upon this pe- 
tition Mayor Mitchel said that he thought, 
in the case of a pavement so important as 
that on Riverside Drive, the city was justi- 
fied in demanding, and paying a higher 
price for, the particular type of asphalt 
pavement that had been proved able to 
stand the traffic of the Drive. This is the 


action that the board has now taken, ap- 
proving the award of a contract to a bidder 
who will use a natural asphalt at a some- 
what higher price than that at which the 
city could have had the work done by the 
same or another contractor using oil 
asphalt. 

This action appears to be a recognition 
of the fact that, when the city of New York 
determines exactly what it wants for a par 
ticular piece of work, it may properly draw 
specifications which will enable it to secure 
the desired material or workmanship. In 
this case the city accomplished the object 
simply by drawing specifications which 
called for the use of Bermudez asphalt and 
separate specifications under which oil 
asphalts might be used. There appears to 
have been full and free competition among 
contractors under each specification, and 
the city might have accepted the lowest bid 
for either class of work. Indeed, there was, 
doubtless, more competition under the al 
ternate specifications than there would have 
been if but a single specification had been 
drawn in which it was attempted to cover 
more than one grade or kind of asphaltic 
material. In the latter case the award 
would presumably have gone to the lowest 
bidder; cheaper asphalt would have been 
used, and the higher priced material would 
have been effectually barred out. 

As to the comparative values of the 
materials under discussion, we have no 
opinion to express; but the principle in- 
volved has an important bearing on effec- 
tive city buying. To prevent graft and 
promote economy in municipal purchases,

purchasing officials with many restrictions 
If these limitations accomplish their object,

no one will deny that they 


sirable; but can the object be most 


attained when a city adopts wide-open 
specifications under which are included dit- 
ferent kinds or grades of materials selling 
at varying prices and awards the contract to 
the lowest bidder? 

lf a municipality drew wide-open specif 
clothing, demanding merely 


that the material should be a fabric weigh- 


cations tor 


ing so many ounces to the yard, it would 
know in advance that the low bid would be 
for shoddy and that shoddy was what the 
city was going to get. If it drew specifi 
cations for a particular grade of wool so 
definitely manu- 
facturer could qualify, there would be no 
competition. On the other hand, if it drew 
alternate specifications under which tenders 
were received for woolen clothing and for 
cotton clothing, or for mixture of wool and 
cotton, it would receive separate bids on 
each and have the option of accepting the 
low bid under either classification. It is 
obvious that it is useless to try to draw a 
specification which would cover both cotton 
and wool; for the bidders on cotton would

chance of getting goods of higher market 
Does not a somewhat similar con- 
dition of affairs apply to specifications for 
a wide variety of municipal supplies and 
equipment, such as motor trucks, fire hose,

tors, street signs, nursery stock, water 
meters, etc., as well as to paving and road 
building materials?

\nother phase of this problem is sug- 
gested by the decision recently announced 
by Justice Clark of the New York Supreme 
Court in a case which under the 
Rochester charter. The charter provides 
that five or more property owners to be 


arose 


assessed for paving or repaving may file a 
petition with the common council, before 
adoption of the final ordinance, specifying 
the material which they desire to be used, 
“but not any particular kind, make, style or 
brand.” Then the council must specify all 
materials so suggested, and such others as 
may be deemed advisable. Within one week

after the ordinance takes effect, a certain 
majority of the property owners affected 
may make a final designation of material, 
subject to the limitation quoted above. In 
the absence of any such designation, the 
choice rests with the board of contract and 
supply, and bids are to be thereafter invited 
and the contract awarded. In this case a 
majority of the owners affected specified 
hitulithic as the material desired, it was 
adopted by the city authorities, and a con- 
tract for the work was let to the lowest 
bidder for bitulithic pavement, although 
there was a lower bid upon an asphalt stone 
mixture pavement. Under a claim that this 
specification of bitulithic violated the char- 
ter prohibition against designation of a 
‘particular kind, make, style or brand of 
material,” because it appears that bitulithic 
material is a patented article, manufactured 
hy one company, suit was brought to enjoin 
award of a contract under the proceedings 
had. In other words, it was claimed that 
there could be no competition for the con- 
tract, to secure which the charter provisions 
were obviously adopted. In dismissing the 
suit, Justice Clark said: 

“The adoption of specifications for a patent 
pavement does not prevent competitive bid- 
ding and that proposition has been decided 
many times and in many states. There is noth- 
ing in the charter * * * which prohibited the 
Common Council from adopting bitulithic 
pavement for a street improvement if that was 
desirable, and there is nothing * * * which 
would preclude property owners from desig- 
nating bitulithic if that was the pavement which 
seemed to them most desirable, and there is 
likewise nothing * * * which prohibits the au- 
thorities from using for such an improvement 
a patented article. * * * The bitulithic pave- 
ment * * * is * * * covered by perfectly valid 
letters patent. * * * It is not merely a certain 
make, style or brand of material, and * * * 
the principle of competitive bidding was not 
destroyed * * *, as is shown by the fact that 
there were a number of bids submitted in good 
faith, and the contract was awarded to the 
lowest bidder, even as against the owner of 
the patented article.”

In both the Rochester and New York 
cases, the purchasing authorities had ap- 
parently determined on the particular mate- 
rial desired before advertising for bids.

tions unless it is intended to consider care-

such a decision with entire freedom from 
prejudice or influence is a peculiarly dif 
ficult task; but we should be loath to he 
lieve that municipal officials are less capable 
f deciding such matters with a fair and 
open mind than are the purchasing agents 
of private corporations. 

The real question to be determined in 
each instance of paving or other public 
work is whether the material to be secured 


is the lowest in price, quality and servic 
considered. The ideal system of municipal 
buying will combine proper safeguards 
against ignorance and dishonesty with a 
large measure of freedom to the responsibl 
officials of each municipality whereby their 
decisions may be based on the results of 
practical experience or on the opinions I 
disinterested experts. How may this ideal 
be most nearly attained ? 





City Planning and Real Estate’ 


By George B. Ford 


Consultant to the Committee on the City Plan of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of 
New York 


N office building is not paying very 
well. The owner goes to the real 
estate expert to find out what the 

matter is. The expert goes minutely 
through all the items of maintenance, up- 
keep and fixed charges. He looks for 
waste and possibilities of improvement in 
janitor, elevator or cleaning service. He 
goes into the cost of heating, lighting and 
power. Does he stop there? No; he ex 
amines also the physical equipment of the 
building. Perhaps he finds that the boiler 
plant is antiquated and that it would be a 
distinct saving to scrap the present plant 
and put ina modern one. Perhaps a change 
in the type of lighting would considerably 
improve the rentability of the offices. Pos 
sibly a rearrangement of the office units 
would make them more attractive. 

Nor does he stop even here. He figures 
to see whether the present improvement is 
all that the location and land value war- 
rant. He may find that it wouid be a dis- 
tinctly better proposition to scrap the whole 
existing structure and build larger and in 
a more modern fashion. In planning such 
a building the expert uses all of his accu- 
mulated data and experience. He lays out 
his plan so as to secure the greatest ease 
of access from the street to all parts of the 
building. He lays out his courts and yards 
so as to secure the maximum value in well 
lighted, rentable space. He may even find it 


* From a paper read February 9, 1915, at the con- 
ference between the Fine Arts Federation of New 
York and representatives of the real estate organi 
zations of New York. 


a net economy to secure a light easement 
over neighboring property. Furthermore, 
he looks to the future and very likely makes 
his columns and foundations strong enough 
to carry additional stories at such times as 
the demand may warrant, and he provides 
for the possibility of adding to his power 
plant and elevator service without having to 
rip out the present plant. 

Let us substitute the city for this office 
building. The maintenance, upkeep and 
handling of fixed charges correspond to 
the “administration” of the city’s business 
The rest is “city planning.” It would apply 
the same science and put the same business- 
like and broad-viewed order into the con- 
trol of the improving of property, w hether 
public or private, that the real estate expert 
puts into the design of his plant. City plan- 
ning is not a squandering of the taxpayers’ 
money on mere prettinesses; it is a regu 
lating of the improvements which the city 
must make for a healthy normal growth so 
that every dollar which the city spends will 
go where it will count the most as a sheer 
business proposition. 

City planning conserves and_ stabilizes 
real estate values. Perhaps its first duty 
is to undertake to prevent as far as pos 
sible the demoralizing shifting of real es 
tate values from which so many cities are 
suffering just now. To prevent this the 
city needs definiteness and evenness of 
growth. It is the work of a city planning 
committee so to direct the development of 
public property and control of the develop 

















190 


ment of private property as to bring about 
this result. To this end careful studies 
should be made and essential data should 
be compiled to show the trend of the 
growth of the city and to determine for 
what kind of development each portion of 
the city is best suited, so that the improve- 
ments undertaken or the restrictions sug 
gested in any district may be such as will 
tend to help its development and to improve 
the real estate values of the neighborhood. 

Again, city planning prevents duplica- 
tion of improvement work. It would 
to it that the subdivision plan which the 
city accepts for an outlying tract will not 
have to be done over again with a great 
waste of the taxpayers’ money twenty-five 
years hence. It would see to it that the 
main thoroughfares do not have to be 
widened at great cost when the growth 
of the city demands more ample _facili- 
ties for traffic or transit lines. City plan- 
ning years ago would have saved New 
York the $7,000,000 it is now spending for 
the extension of Seventh Avenue. City 
planning would have avoided the spending 
of $5,000,000 for three little breathing 
spots in the lower East Side, in New York. 
City planning would have avoided the great 
land condemnation costs for a water-front 
improvement that so many cities are now 
paying. It would see to it that every im- 
provement should be designed with a view 
not only to present needs, but, as far as it 
is possible to foresee, to the best interests- 
of the city and the property owner when 
the population is double or treble what it 
is now. 

City planning codrdinates the improve- 
ments of a city. For example, in con- 
sidering a waterfront terminal develop- 
ment, it would see to it not only that the 
actual terminal plan itself was a good busi- 
ness proposition for all concerned and that 
it was laid out as a thoroughly economical 
and efficient plant, but it would also take 
into account the problem of so designing 
the whole surrounding territory as to best 
fit it for its normal use in connection with 
the terminal. It would look into the layout 
of approaching streets to see if they are so 
located and of such widths, grades and sur- 
faces as to best facilitate trucking to and 
from the terminal. It would see that there 
are proper transit approaches for those who 
work in or use the terminal. It would see 


see 


THE AMERICAN 





CITY 


that the terminal railroad facilities were 
coordinated with the trunk and belt line 
systems of the city. It would see that the 
lot and block and street units of the im- 
mediately surrounding area were best suited 
to such factory and warehouse use as 
should go with the terminal. It would also 
consider the neighboring waterfront to plan 
for its future use as an extension of the 
immediate system. In short, it would make 
every part of the area as profitable as pos- 
sible to the property owners. It would 
bring together into one harmonious scheme 
all the various improvements in each dis- 
trict, and would bring together district de- 
velopments into one comprehensive, prac- 
tical plan for the city as a whole. 

City planning would determine the rela- 
tive urgency of various improvements and 
see that the taxpayers’ money was spent in 
each case where it would do the most good. 
For example, should a group of people in 
a particular section try to induce the city to 
bring an extension of the rapid transit sys- 
tem out into their district, the data of a 
city plan committee would show not only 
what territory, how many families, what 
business and industries, how many em- 
ployes, etc., would be served by this ex- 
tension, but it would also show by its fig- 
ures how much more urgent might be, for 
instance, a certain extension in another sec- 
tion of the city, only in the latter case the 
citizens had not gotten together to urge 
their needs. Good business demands that 
the more urgent matter be undertaken first. 
It would determine a comprehensive, prac- 
tical plan for the development of the whole 
city, each part of which would fit in with 
every other part as in the ideal manufac- 
turing plant. Each part would be best 
suited to its use. Each part could be ex- 
tended as the business grew without disar- 
ranging any of the original plant, and it 
would be elastic enough to permit of such 
changes in the plan as new conditions might 
demand. . 

To carry out a program as outlined above, 
the city needs the codperation of those who 
know real estate and real estate values. It 
is so largely a matter of getting the great- 
est use and value out of property that it is 
obvious that the city should have the ad- 
vantage of the best real estate experience. 

The real estate man owes it to his clients 
and to the city to help in every way he can.

Transforming a Nuisance into a Public Asset 


The Jones Falls Improvement in Baltimore 


By Calvin W. Hendrick 


Chief Eagineer, Sewerage Commission and Consulting Engineer to Board of Estimates, Baltimore, Md. 


VER since the incorporation of Balti- widened to 100 feet, with a small park bor- 
EF. more as a town, about 1740, the ex- dering the Falls, similar to the park on the 
istence of a creek, known as Jones’ north side of Mt. Roval Avenue. This 

Falls (named after a man who owned a ‘ 
farm through which this creek 
ran), has caused the taxpayers 
serious loss from floods and for 
maintenance of bridges. In 


would make a continuation of Mt. Royal 






MO.4 PARR Passenyer Sta 
later years the creek, having 
become an open sewer, was a 
nuisance on account of odors 
and mosquitoes. 

As the city grew, the question 
of what to do with this stream 
was under constant discussion, 
and for fifty years numerous 
plans were suggested, such 
diverting the stream from the 
city, etc. About the year 1868 
the construction of retaining 
walls was begun, the cost of 
which has amounted to about 
$2,000,000. These retaining 
walls, while confining the water 
of the stream to a channel, did 
not stop the flooding in the 
lower business section, as the sewers enter- 
ing the stream, or near the bottom of the 
lalls, caused water to back into the low 
section through these drains. Moreover, 
the bridges still had to be maintained. 

In advocating the enclosure of the Falls 
in 1906, the writer recommended that a 
street be constructed over the redeemed 
land, and in studying the plans for the road- 
way it was found that the existing street 
crossings from Baltimore Street to Madison 
Street could be met without changing the 
grade of the intersecting streets; but that 
from Madison Street north it would be 
necessary to raise the grade of the road- 
way. It was therefore further recom- 
mended by the writer that a viaduct be con- 
structed from Madison Street north, rising 
on a 3.4 per cent grade to the intersection 
of the existing bridge grades of Eager 
Street, Chase Street, Guilford Avenue and PROVEMENT 
Biddle Street, and that the property on the Stead Banh: Wine te Simei

tracting it from the 1go1-5 rate of 167.1, we 
have a reduction of in points or 43.4 
per cent in nine years—a baby saving divi- 
dend that challenges comparison with that 
of any other city of the first class. During 
these nine years 1,157,333 living babies 
have been born in the city of New York. 
If the infant mortality rate of the five years 
previous had prevailed, there would have 
been 193,390 infant deaths instead of 139,- 
444 which actually occurred. This shows a 
saving of 53,946 infant lives. On the other 
hand, if the infant mortality rate of 1914 
(94.6) had prevailed throughout the period, 
only 109,483 babies would have died out of 
the 1,157,333 which were born. This means 
that if the city’s 1914 baby-saving efficiency 
had been operative during the eight pre- 
vious years, 30,000 additional baby deaths 
would have been prevented. 7

deaths are:

1. Improvement of the milk supply 

2. Education of mothers 

3. Education of general public 

4. Care of well babies 

5. Treatment of sick babies 

6. Current control sheet of baby deaths 


The last item is the live wire in baby- 
saving effort. It means going through the 
death certificates as they are returned to the 
Department of Health and tabulating from 
day to day all deaths under one year. This 
is done primarily to ascertain the address 
—i.e., the city block in which each death 
occurred—thus making it possible to turn in 
an alarm to the workers in any district 
where deaths are increasing. After that 
are tabulated the cause and contributing 
causes, exact age in months and days, and 
date of occurrence in relation to date of 
return. As the deaths are taken off, they 
are-distributed by districts and the totals 
for the weeks debited to their respective 
districts for purposes of comparison with 
previous weeks and with corresponding 
week of the previous year. This control 
sheet is the Director’s hand on the pulse of 
the infant mortality situation, and without 
it baby welfare effort cannot be efficiently 
directed.

That the work of the 
Commission represents the highest author

fact that its reports have been published and 
given wide circulation by the Federal Gov- 
ernment, and that they have been formally 
endorsed by public health officials and by 
the milk industry itself. 

Nor as pertains to the 1914 rate is there 
justification for ignoring the Better Babies: 
Better Mothers: Better City slogan of 
Mayor Mitchel’s Baby Week Commission. 
Despite past achievements, New York was 
not satisfied. Its infant mortality rate for 
1913 was I10f.g per thousand births, the low- 
ést up to that year, but there still occurred 
many needless deaths. To prevent these it, 
was believed there must be a re-awakening 
of public interest. The attention of the citi- 
zens, particularly of the substantial busi 
ness men, must be called more pointedly to 
the work bejig done and to the many needs 
of the field that had not as yet been met 
With this purpose in view there was or- 
ganized a city-wide advertising campaign.

day’s events. And the newspapers did tell 
the story. It is doubtful if any other social 
movement with only a week's preparation 
has ever had so much and so helpful public- 
ity. It is estimated that the 230 papers, 


large and small, dailies and weeklies in New 
York, devoted nearly 1,500 columns of 
space to Baby Week news and Baby Week 
lessons. Several of the large dailies gave as 
much as thirty columns during the eight 
days of greatest publicity. Did it help?

The Prevention of Odors at City Refuse 
Disposal Works* 
By Rudolph Hering, D. Sc. 


ITY refuse when delivered at the dis- 
C posal plant may cause, in its raw 
state, offensive odors, chiefly after 
the beginning of the putrefaction of some 
of its parts. The odors to be discussed in 
this paper relate only to those which are 
associated with the final disposal of refuse. 
The different parts of a city’s refuse are 
enumerated as follows: Garbage, dead ani- 
mals, night soil, stable manure, street 
sweepings, ashes and rubbish. 

All of these parts can be treated and 
finally disposed of by incineration. Gar- 
bage and dead animals can be treated by 
their reduction to grease and fertilizer. 
Or garbage, dead animals, night soil and 
manure can be buried as a final disposition. 
Manure, street sweepings, ashes and rub- 
bish can sometimes be satisfactorily dis- 
posed of by dumping, and garbage some- 
times as food for pigs. 

The odors which may arise in connection 
with these various methods of treatment 
may be classed in two groups: 

First. Odors from the escape of pure 
gases which are soon converted into other 
gases that are not offensive. For instance, 
sulphurated hydrogen persists in an offen- 
sive condition so long as it is concentrated 
or not decomposed, but when diluted in a 
sufficient quantity of air it is altered into 
other inoffensive compounds. 

The general remedy for eliminating such 
odors, therefore, is either the discharge of 
the gases into an air current sufficiently 
great to get a quick dispersion and dilution, 


*From a paper read before the Sanitary Engineering 
Section of the American Public Health Association, at 
its recent annual convention. 


or the passage through a medium which 
produces a chemical destruction by fire, or 
through a disinfecting chamber, or by a dis- 
persion into and a dilution by a sufficiently 
ample current of water. A disappearance 
of odorous gases by dilution in the atmos- 
phere is generally quite rapid. 

Second. The odors from vapors which 
are the gaseous forms of substances which 
normally exist either in liquid or solid 
form, and which, in the case of an inciner- 
ator, are frequently accompanied by ex- 
tremely minute particles of solid matter or 
dust. For instance, we may refer to the 
odors from the vapors and dust particles 
which arise from a chimney and persist un- 
til so diluted that the odor from them has 
become unnoticeable. Their disappearance 
by decomposition in the atmosphere, if it 
takes place at all, is extremely slow. 

The remedy is substantially as above. 
namely, a quick discharge and dispersion in 
a sufficiently large air current if in an open 
country, or a passage through fire or 
through a disinfecting air chamber, or by 
dispersion and dilution in a sufficiently large 
current of water. 

For the prevention of odors it is of first 
importance that all solids or liquids causing 
them are removed as quickly and as thor- 
oughly as is financially practicable. It is 
further important that the odorous gases 
and vapors be removed by natural or arti- 
ficial ventilation, with the aid of furnace 
heat, blowers or air jets, or by a discharge 
into the atmosphere in a manner to effect 
a thorough dispersion and dilution. 

Ordinary ventilation does not remove the 









































THE AMERICAN CITY 197 


vapors which are held at solid surfaces by 
absorption. A jet of compressed air fre- 
quently played against the interior surfaces 
of the buildings and against the clothing 
of attendants will remove this cause of 
odor. 

Odorous solids and liquids, from which 
the molecules carrying the odor are de- 
tached and rise up into the air, should not 
be long exposed about the works. Special 
care should be taken, when the atmosphere 
is moist and warm, to suppress the odors 
about the works, because under this condi- 
tion our olfactories are most sensitive to 
odors. The tiring of the sensation of smell 
when continually active forms some ex- 
cuse for neglecting to keep the plants 
wholly inoffensive. It would be well, there 
fore, to establish reasonable rules, so as to 
control the suppression of odors and to en 
force the rules even if men about the plants 
do not feel the necessity therefor. 

It is most convenient now to distuss the 
odors as they relate to each of the above 
enumerated parts of a city’s refuse, and in 
doing this I shall adopt the reverse order 
which was given above. 


Feeding to Pigs 

Feeding garbage to pigs should be pro- 
hibited unless the garbage is delivered fair- 
ly fresh and without offensive odors. No 
decomposition sufficient to produce putre- 
faction of any part of the garbage should 
be allowed to have taken place. Slight 
odors of kitchen waste, such as we perceive 
at the collection can, are neither injurious 
nor objectionable, nor can there be objec- 
tion to the odors of the first decomposition 
perceived when parts of the garbage have 
turned sour. Unless fed before putrefac- 
tion has begun, garbage should be disposed 
of in other ways. 


Dumping 

In order to discuss odors arising from the 
dumping of stable manure, street sweepings 
and ashes, we should discriminate between 
the several parts. 

Stable manure, if put on fields and util- 
ized or dumped on vacant grounds, may 
cause the familiar odor which, according to 
the locality, may or may not be objection- 
able. In the former case, dumping should 
not be continued and old mantre dumps 
should be completely covered with a few 
inches of ashes or earth. 





Street sweepings, if dumped on vacant 
ground, should also be treated in this same 
manner, although the odors are generally 
not objectionable. 

\shes do not have offensive odors, but 
cause objection only from the dust which 
is raised by dumping and by winds 

Burial 

Burial of garbage, dead animals, night 
soil and manure, is an efficient method of 
at once preventing all offensive odors. It 
is the oldest and most common method used 
for disposing of all such organic waste 
matter as cannot be more profitably treated 
in other ways. 

Reduction 

Reduction of garbage and dead animals 
is practiced in many large cities. Of all 
treatments this one has produced the most 
objectionable odors, although it is neither 
difficult nor very expensive to prevent 
them. 

These objectionable odors are due partly 
to the delivered garbage when it is tem- 
porarily stored at the plant until treated, 
partly to the fumes produced during the 
treatment, partly to the exposed tankage 
and partly to the exposed liquids discharged 
from the digesters and grease-separating 
tanks. 

To prevent the creation and maintenance 
of these objectionable odors, the works 
should first be kept scrupulously clean. The 
operation should then be so arranged that 
the freshly delivered garbage can be placed 
into the digesters within a very short time, 
and best at once, and not be exposed in the 
open until it gets foul. 

The gases and vapors arising in an as- 
cending air current from the digesters, as 
well as from the presses, naphtha tanks, 
and wherever odors from the cooked gar- 
bage may be generated, should be caught 
in hoods closely placed, of sufficient size 
and proper shape, and discharging into 
pipes of diameters properly proportioned to 
carry away the respective amounts of odor- 
ous air ascending from each hood. The 
draft into the hoods and the circulation in 
the pipes is best effected by a blower of 
ample capacity. 

The odorous air thus collected from all 
places where it is formed should be deliv- 
ered at the best place for treatment. This 
place is generally below the grates of the 
furnaces connected with the operation of 








) 








198 rHE AMER 


the works, where it can be passed thre ugh 
the fires by forced draft and be thoroughly 
purified by intense heat. If the quantit 
of this air is too great for serving the regu 
lar furnaces, an additional special furnace 
may be built to cremate the excess in qua 
tity, as the complete destruction of the 
causes of all this odorous air is important 
Or the objectionable air may be discharged 
into the rear pass of the boilers, which may 
sufficiently eliminate the odors. Practicall 
all of the objections that have been mack 
to the installation of garbage reductior 
works have been caused by the foul odors 
frequently emanating from them 

\nother method of purifying this odor 
ous air is by passing it through a disinfect 
ing chamber, which method, however, is 
generally less efficient and more costly 

\ noticeable improvement is often gained 
by making use of a compressed air jet to 
aerate occasionally the interior walls of the 
building in which garbage reduction is 
effected and the surfaces of all apparatus 
within the same, and even the clothing of 
the attendants, which has been known to 
retain the odor for hours 

The foul liquids from such plants should 
at once be discharged into and carried away 


by a sewer pipe and disposed of as sewage. 


Incineration 
Incineration can dispose of all classes of 
city refuse without exception It is a 


method by which all classes when thor 
oughly mixed can have the odors of all 
parts completely destroyed, which may 
otherwise create a nuisance. 

To accomplish this end, it is necessary 
to incinerate the refuse at a high temper- 
ature, nominally at least 1250° F., so as to 
guarantee the sufficient combustion of all 
organic matter and thereby to remove all 
sources of odor. Burning at a low tem 
perature is apt to leave some of the or 
ganic matter only partly destroyed, and in 
this incompletely destroyed condition some 
of it emits a strong, pungent odor. 

To guarantee the prevention of a nuis- 
ance from refuse incinerators it is, there- 
fore, necessary to have high temperature 
furnaces, which allow of the escape from 
the stack chiefly of carbon dioxide, if the 
combustion is complete, and monoxide if 
it is less so, but sufficient to prevent offense 

When the combustion is perfect, there is 
no visible discharge from the stack. When 


ICAN CITY 


smoke is seen to escape, it furnishes evi- 
dence that unburnt matter may also be dis- 
charged. Most of this matter will be or 
ganic, because of its lightness, and it is 
probable that it will have an offensive odor 
which can be perceived where the fumes 
strike the ground or a window. This fact 
has caused frequent complaints to be 
lodged from inhabited areas to which these 
fumes have drifted. Minute and even in- 
visible particles of solid and partly burnt 
organic matter are quickly dissolved and 
decomposed in the air, as is the case with 
gases. They drift and may travel a long 
distance as invisible clouds. 

\ pungent burnt garbage odor was recog- 
nized by myself on one occasion at a dis- 
tance of over a mile from the stack dis 
charging objectionable smoke, with a very 
faint wind blowing from the stack to the 
point of observation. 

In order to successfully incinerate refuse 
in high temperature furnaces, so that no 
odorous smoke will escape, it is necessary 
to use forced draft aud to regulate the fires 
carefully and intelligently so that the com- 
hustion is at all times perfect and that no 
odorous smoke will escape. 

lo prevent odors about the plant, no gar- 
hage should be stored longer than a day 
before it is incinerated, although an offense 
from mixed refuse does not arise as soon 
as from garbage alone as generally deliv- 
ered at a reduction plant. It is generally 
wise to arrange hoods and ventilating pipes 
in the furnace building to receive and carry 
the air, which may have become somewhat 
foul from contact with the refuse, to below 
the furnace grates and use with forced 
draft, so that the intense heat of the fire 
will thoroughly purify it. 

As at reduction works, it is advisable to 
keep incinerating works scrupulously clean. 
No refuse should be left scattered about. 
Dust from the final clinker and ashes should 
be properly controlled and the floors of the 
buildings should be swept or washed daily. 
The walls of the buildings, the tools, cloth- 
ing, etc., should be given, as often as found 
desirable, a blast from nozzles supplied with 
compressed air. 

\ttention to the above-mentioned facts 
and to the conclusions drawn therefrom 
should prevent all offensive odors at refuse 
works, whichever of the best methods of 
disposal may be employed.

alumina is analyzed when delivered at the 
plant. 

The sulphate of alumina is added to the 
water before it enters the aerators and is 
thoroughly mixed. There are also connec 
tions so that it is possible to add the alu 
mina at other points. It is very important 
that the alumina be thoroughly mixed with 
the water 

The average amount of sulphate of 
alumina used during the four years was 
.g18 grains per gallon, or about 130 
pounds per million gallons. The maximum 
amount of alumina used was I.35 grains per 
gallon, or about 193 pounds per million 
gallons. The minimum, .37 grains per gal

lhe water flows by gravity to the filters, 
but before entering the filters the sterilizing 
agent, calcium hypochlorite, is added. The 
average amount of calcium hypochlorite 
used during the four years was .049 grains 
per gallon, or about 7 pounds per million 
gallons. The maximum amount of calcium 
hypochlorite used was .o80 grains per gal- 
lon, or about 11.7 pounds per million gal- 
lons; the minimum was .002 grains per gal- 
lon, or about .3 pounds per million gallons 

The calcium hypochlorite is purchased 
under specifications, the requirements being 
that it shall not contain less than 33 per 
cent of available chlorine 

There are ten concrete gravity filters, 
each 20 x 22% feet, or a sand area of about 
450 square feet each. Each filter has a

rated capacity of 1,250,000 gallons per day. 

In washing these filters air and water are 
used separately. The filter bed consists of 
8 inches gravel and 36 inches of sand. The 
system of strainers for introducing the air 
is on top of the gravel, while the wash 
water is introduced through the strainer 
system under the gravel. 

rhe air system has given some trouble, 
owing to the pipes becoming cracked and 
filled with sand. 

The air and water used in washing the 
filters are stored in a gasometer, the lower 
part holding water and the upper the air. 
This tank is at a sufficient elevation to 
supply enough pressure for washing. 

Another feature of this plant is that the 
wash water from the filters is stored in a 
concrete reservoir 65 feet in diameter and 
11 feet deep. The wash water is allowed 
to settle, when it is pumped back into and 
mixed with the raw water entering the 
aerator. In this way very little water is 
wasted, 

While the average amount of wash water 
used (2.27 per cent) compares favorably 
with that used at other plants, the actual 
loss of water averages far below, being 
106 per cent. 

\s the water is treated with calcium hy- 
pochlorite before it enters the filters and 
only filtered water is used in washing the 
filters, the bacterial quality of the wash 
water which is pumped back is always supe- 
rior to the raw water and improves the 
quality of the raw water.

What Pittsburgh is Doing to Improve Its 
Housing Conditions 


HE Housing Conference of Pittsburgh 
is composed of representatives of 
most of the social and civic agencies 
of the city whose work in any way brings 
them into contact with housing conditions 
lhe organizations include the Associated 
Charities, Chamber of Commerce, Civic 
Club, Christian Social Service Union, Iren 
Kaufmann Settlement, Kingsley House, 
Pittsburgh Real Estate Board, Association 
for the Improvement of the Poor, Social 
Service Committee of the Unitarian 
Church, Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion, United Hebrew Relief Association and 
the Juvenile Court Association. rhe 
President, who has been active in promot- 
ing housing reform, is the Rev. Charles F. 
Snyder; Vice-President, Mrs. Franklin P. 
lams; Secretary, Percy R. Williams. 

The Housing Conference acts as a clear- 
ing house for the various social and civic 
agencies in so far as their work for the« 
improvement of housing conditions is con- 
cerned. Reports of unsanitary conditions 
are made each week by social workers from 
all parts of the city. The originals of these 
reports covering the various complaints 
are sent to the Bureau of Sanitation, while 
copies are kept in the office of the Confer- 
ence, the secretary giving personal atten- 
tion to each case. The Conference has no 
paid workers, and thus far has operated 
with modest expenditure. 

Reports just completed by the Housing 
Conference indicate more progress toward 
better housing during the last six months 
than has been witnessed in Pittsburgh be- 
fore. A thorough survey of the city con- 
vinced the members that there were hun 
dreds of dilapidated houses in Pittsburgh, 
unfit for any purpose, which were being 
rented as homes by poor families. A sus- 
tained effort is being made to have owners 
of such buildings tear them down, except 
when it appears the building can be made 
fit for habitation by repairs. 

The Housing Conference has not the 
power to order any building torn down or 
repaired, but its activities are ably supple 
mented by Dr. J. F. Edwards, Director of 





the Pittsburgh Department of Health. The 
function of the Conference in this work is 
to conduct investigations and offer sugges 
tions to the Department of Health and to 
encourage civic action in the promotion of 
improved housing and _ sanitation. he 
architectural and construction department 
of the Conference is maintained to furnish, 
free of charge, information relative to mod 
ern building construction at a cost that will 
permit of reasonable rents and a fair re- 
turn on money invested in dwellings. Dur- 
ing six months prior to December 1, 1914, 
8o8 owners were notified by the Department 
of Health either to repair or to tear down 
their buildings. There were 77 buildings 
repaired and 250 razed. In cases where no 
action followed, the Department took the 
matter up with the owners. 

It has been demonstrated in a large num- 
ber of notable instances during the last 
vear that property owners in Pittsburgh ar: 
willing to codperate in the movement to 
iniprove housing conditions. Whole rows 
1f ramshackle buildings, headquarters for 
disease and filth, have been torn down at 
the suggestion of the health officers or 
members of the Housing Conference. In 
a large number of instances such proper- 
ties are owned by estates and are managed 
by renting agencies. When the personal

about $275 per running foot for the first

mainder of the work should be carried out 
at a unit cost considerably below this 
amount. 





The “Places” 


of St. Louis 


An Effective Development of Residential Streets with Building Restrictions 


By John Noyes 
Landscape Designer, The Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis 


UT-OF-TOWN visitors to St. Louis 
QO are probably more impressed with 
the beauty of the homes and the 
residential sections of the city than with any 
other thing. If they are of an enthusiastic 
nature, and particularly beauty-loving, they 
usually go into raptures when passing 
through some of the more finished “Places,” 
where many of the best homes are to be 
found. Vandeventer Place, Westmoreland 
Place and Portland Place seem to impress 
the visitor most of all. If the visitor has 
traveled over the country much, he doubt 
less wonders why a scheme so simple and 
practical, and yet so rare, should not have 
been adopted in other cities long ago. 

The first “Place” of any importance was 
Vandeventer, laid out some forty years ago 
by Mr. Julius Pitzman, the originator of 
the idea. Mr. Pitzman, familiar with the 
success of Baron Haussmann in Paris, and 
the resulting attractiveness of the streets 
where building restrictions had heen im 
posed, was fired with a resolve to give St 
Louis one at least that would be the equal 
of any residential street in the country. His 
idea became so popular that it was not long 
before he was engaged to lay out many 
other “Places” throughout the city. Port 
land Place, Westmoreland Place and Flora 


Boulevard, mentioned elsewhere in this 
article, were all laid out by Mr. Pitzman. 

To-day there are dozens of them of one 
sort or .another in this city. Some are 
nothing less than good-sized subdivisions of 
several streets, similar to the subdivisions 
of Cleveland, New York, Boston and othe 
cities. Vandeventer, Portland and West- 
moreland Places are simply straight, single 
streets, and to my mind it is only to such 
as these that the name “Place” should be 
applied. At any rate, it is to them that I 
shall limit my discussion. The photographs 
a>companying this article are views of Port- 
land and Westmoreland, two “Places” on 
which the more costly type of home is 
found, and Flora Boulevard, a “Place” for 
homes costing $4,000 or more. Flora Boule- 
vard was laid out as an approach to the 
main gate of the Missouri Botanical Gar- 
den, hence the name “Boulevard.” 

The cooling breezes in summer are main- 
ly from the south in St. Louis, making the 
lots that run north and south, and the streets 
that run east and west, the popular ones for 
residences. So it is that these “Places” run 
east and. west, almost without exception. 
They are usually several blocks in length, 
with the intersecting north and south streets 
left out wherever possible, thus leaving 
them nearly intact their entire length. The

Motorizing the Little Rock Fire Department 
By Charles S. Hafer 


Chief, Fire Department, Little Rock, Ark. 


ITHIN the last two years the city 
of Little Rock, Ark., has greatly 
developed her fire department by 

the introduction of motor-drawn apparatus 
Many intelligent horses have been trained 
in the Little Rock department, but the day 
of the horse is going fast. Our motor ap- 
paratus has often proved its worth, not only 
in putting us at the scene of the fire earlie: 
than the horse-drawn apparatus could pos 
sibly have done, but in working perfectly 
after its arrival. During the month of June 
1914—when the department broke the rec- 
ord for any previous month in its history, 
answering sixty-six alarms—we would have 
been helpless without our motor equipment 
as the runs were all long and horses could 
not have stood the strain. 

Especial proof of this was given at one 
conflagration, when thirty houses and 
churches were destroyed or damaged. The 
fire, fanned by a strong wind, jumped from 
block to block, causing us to change lines 
of hose so often that we had something on 
the move continually. Nothing but motor 
or steam-driven machines could have 
dragged the lines of hose to the new loca 
tions. This fire would have spread widely 
had it not been for the quick action of the 


motor apparatus lwice during 1913 the 
quick response of the tractor-drawn aerial 


truck no doubt saved people’ from sutfto 


cation, if not from being burned to death

from the stairs and fire escapes by the heat 
and smoke were taken from the third story,

Improvements and Results 

Kight pieces of motor apparatus have 
been added to our department since I9gI1 
One of the most up-to-date and modern 
central stations in the United States and 
one of the prettiest residence stations have 
been constructed, and additional men have 
been placed in service. The City Council, 
composed of sixteen practical business men 
led by a business man for mayor, has appro 
priated $130,000 for improvement of the 
fire department. Of this amount about half 
has been expended for buildings and the 
other half for equipment 

These improvements, which have bee 
embraced in the recommendations made in 
my annual reports from time to time, were 
also recommended by competent engineers

Some Town Planning Principles Restated 


By Thomas Adams 


Town Planning Adviser to the Commission of Conservation, Canada 


What Town Planning Includes 
OWN or city planning is the applica- 
tion of scientific principles to all mat 
ters connected with the town or city. 
The factors which constitute a city and the 
order in which they do so are: 

1. Industry and external transportation. 

2. Healthy living conditions for the citi- 
zens. 

3. Internal transportation. 

4. Markets and food supply. 

5. Education. 

6. Recreation. 

7. Civic center and monumental build 
ings. 

The first object of the town plan should 
be to conserve and provide for the exten- 
sion of its business interests, and to apply 
healthy conditions to the dwellings of the 
people. Complementary to both these ob- 
jects, it is desirable to secure efficiency in 
transportation and in the supply and distri 
bution of food, etc., and lastly it is needful 
to give expression to those communal and 
social interests which are represented in 
universities, schools, parks, playgrounds 
town halls, museums, churches, etc. In this 
matter we are considering not the ethical 
importance of these institutions, but their 
logical order in the planning and building 
up of the city. 


The Object of the Town Plan 

The three things to be aimed at in cit) 
planning are convenience, amenity and 
proper sanitary conditions. Under conve- 
nience we include everything that pertains 
to the efficient discharge of business, its 
protection and extension, the width and con 
struction of streets, the disposition of rail- 
way tracks and economic distribution gen- 
erally. Under amenity we include light and 
air both in factory and home, proper regard 
for environment, the preservation of valu 
able physical features which cannot be re 
created, such as forest trees, separation of 
factory from residential areas, regulations 
of heights of buildings, etc. In regard to 
proper sanitary provisions, the first essen- 
tial in any city is its water supply, and com 
plementary to that is an efficient system of 


sewage disposal. That matter affects the 
city life as a whole, but there are also those 
methods which can only be secured by 
proper action on the part of the individual 
citizen. In that respect we have to regulate 
the collection of the garbage and the clean- 
ing up of back-yards, etc. There is, of 
course, a certain overlapping in regard to 
these three objects, but they may be roughly 
classified as above. The heights of build 
ings, for instance, require to be regulated 
in relation to the traffic of the city—i. e., for 
convenience and economy—as well as for 
the purpose of amenity. 


Convenience and Sanitation 

he functions of the engineer and his 
architect have to be more carefully consid 
ered than hitherto in regard to the town 
plan. In connection with convenience, we 
require the engineer to consider highways 
from the point of view of their planning and 
direction, as well as from the point of view 
of their construction. The lines, widths 
and direction of the main arterial roads 
are among the most important things to be 
considered in the planning of a city. The 
relation of these to the secondary streets 
of the town and the relation of both to the 
system of sewerage and water supply dis 
tribution are matters in regard to which 
he is the proper adviser. He it is, also, 
who has to consider questions of transpor 
tation by rail and waterway, and the loca 
tion and planning of factory areas in rela 
tion to the railway and waterway systet 
It is obvious, of course, that he is the man 
to deal with the sewerage and water supply 
systems as a whole, so far as planning and 
construction are concerned. 

lhe architect comes in in regard to thes« 
matters, to deal with the hygienic conditions 
in the factory and the home, the grouping 
and setting out of buildings in relation to 
the street, and necessarily in regard to all 
matters of architectural design as far as 
these affect convenience and _ sanitatior 
lhe architect should codperate with the et 
gineer in the planning which relates to 
these matters. The medical officer has his 
function to perform in criticising and cor

recting the work of the engineer so as to 
secure adequate protection for public health 
All these professions have their interest in 
the part of the city plan which relates to 
convenience and sanitation, but the proper 
order in which they should advise is engi- 
neer, architect and medical officer. Mis 
takes are being made every day because we 
do not recognize this order. 


Amenity 

In regard to amenity we include the mat- 
ters which almost entirely come within the 
domain of the architect, including the land- 
scape architect, although in this regard it 
is the duty of the engineer to codperate 
with the architect. The architect has to 
consider the height and character of build- 
ings, the preservation of natural features, 
the position and layout of parks and play- 
grounds, the open spaces around dwellings 
and factories, the disposition and grouping 
of civic centers and public buildings. 


Cooperation and Finance 

I have referred to the necessity for co- 
operation between the architect and engi- 
neer. It is also necessary in connection 
with town planning to have codperation 
between different municipalities and be- 
tween municipalities and owners. Here 
comes in the work of- administrator. We 
have to look to him for considerations of 
finance. For instance, there is the impor- 
tant question of spreading the cost of a 
scheme over a period of time so as to se- 
cure that the present generation will not 
pay for the benefits which will accrue to 
posterity, but that there shall be an even 
distribution of cost in proportion to benefit 
received. Secondly, there is the question 
of adjusting the cost and method of devel- 
opment to the character of buildings to be 
erected. Streets serving industrial areas 
should be of different construction from the 
streets serving residential areas, and the 
latter streets should be of less width than 
the main thoroughfares. 

The lawyer has also an important part to 
play in the preparation of town planning 
schemes, although his position is frequently 
disregarded until the effect of his advice 
is that the propositions of the architect and 
engineer are impracticable. As a matter 
of fact, the framing of the provisions of 
the scheme, their adjustment to legal con- 
ditions, the extent to which they are prac- 


tical under existing law, etc., are vital con- 
siderations in connection with the prepara- 
tion of town plans. That is why, in proper 
town planning, legislation is necessary as a 
preliminary to the preparation of town 
planning schemes. An engineer and an 
architect may visualize a fine scheme for 
laying out a city; it may be based on sound 
principles; it may be perfect from the pub- 
lic point of view; but what value is it if 
there is no machinery for carrying it out, 
and no means of giving its principles effect 
unless at prohibitive cost to the community ? 
Before we can get effective town planning, 
therefore, we have to have the cooperation 
of the best skill which can be brought to 
bear upon it by the engineer, the architect 
and the lawyer, and each has an important 
function to perform throughout all stages 
of its preparation. 


What a Town Planning Scheme Is 

his will be realized all the more with 
regard to the fact that a town planning 
scheme does not deal alone with the beauti- 
fication of a city, but enters into the root 
questions of its economic and engineering 
development. Town planning schemes in 
Britain, such as those of Birmingham and 
Ruislip, include provisions with regard to 
the laying out of new streets, widening ex- 
isting streets, adjusting street boundaries, 
relaxing local by-laws, submission of estate 
subdivisions for municipal approval, modi- 
fication of plan as circumstances change, 
appropriation of land for specific purposes, 
fixing of building lines, determination of 
proportion of building land which should 
be covered with buildings, limitation of 
heights of buildings, fixing a maximum 
number of buildings to each acre, fixing of 
zones for industrial and residential pur- 
poses, prevention of nuisances, etc., and 
including the important questions of com- 
pensation for injury caused to property and 
of recovery of betterment caused by the 
scheme. 

We see at once how necessary it is to 
have proper power to initiate and carry out 
a scheme both for the protection of the 
municipality and for the purpose of se- 
curing equity to the owners of land. It has 
been suggested that in these matters land 
owners in Britain are willing to submit to 
restrictions which would not be acceptable 
to land owners in America. I think that is 
because we do not understand the extent to 

















* 





which land owners as a whole in a city will 
cooperate in securing right conditions when 
the restrictions affect them as a whole and 
not individually. Moreover, in America 
many of the larger owners of real estate 
have themselves begun to voluntarily apply 
restrictions and to carry out what we call 
private town planning schemes. Much of 
what is suggested is to the effect that prin 
ciples which owners of real estate find 
beneficial to their own interest when ap- 
plied to their estates should be made of 
general application, and should be extended 
to areas which are used for housing the 
poor as well as to those which are used 
for housing the well-to-do. 

While the importance of legislation has 
to be emphasized, there is much that can be 
done by municipalities while waiting for it. 
Topographical maps of all cities require to 
be prepared. These maps should includ 
details of the buildings already erected, the 
distribution of population, and of traffic 
conditions. In San Francisco it is esti- 
mated that $26,000,000 was the cost of im 
provements which might have been avoided 
if the city planning had been adjusted to 
the topography. There is need for more 
investigation of existing conditions in re- 
gard to traffic distribution, factory and resi- 
dential location, layout of railway stations 
and harbor fronts and the inter-relation of 
these. Town planning for the future is 
cheaper than replanning areas which have 
already been developed, and has not the 
same injurious result on property. 

It has been proved that with healthy con- 
ditions the mortality in the city need not 
be higher than that in the country. There 
is a great cry of taking people back to the 
land. So far as that is practicable, it is 
desirable to encourage it, but it is well 
known that in every civilized country cities 
are growing, and there are few who will 
venture the opinion that they are likely to 
cease to grow in the future. We have to 
try to bring more land to the people as well 
as to take the people to the land. 


Is Town Planning a Fad? 

There are men who think interference 
with what they call natural growth and any 
kind of originality is a sin. To them town 
planning, and even projects for improve- 
ment of housing conditions, are visionary ; 
they look to individual regeneration for all 
measures of reform. These men are un-

sound in their judgment because they fail 

appreciate the fact that the city and 
homes that constitute part of the city are 
artificial creations, and that in all things 
artificial we have to improve as we progress 
ind regulate as we grow. 

Chere are others who think that all things 
fanciful and picturesque are fads, there 
fore town planning is a fad That is be 
cause they may have failed to inquire what 
town planning is or have been misled as to 
its meaning

ning relates only to the esthetic side of city 
life and does not enter directly into its 
business, its ethical and its public health 
conditions, is responsible for this error. It 
is desirable that citizens should aim at 
making their city beautiful, that they should 
endeavor to give expression in fine build 
ings and streets to their civic ideals, but 
these things, after all, are only the coping 
stones of the city structure, of which the 
foundation is the efficient workshop and the 
healthy home. 


Town Planning and Growth 

We see, then, how broad-based town 
planning is. We see also that the improve- 
ment of housing and sanitary conditions is 
not detached from town planning, but is an 
essential part of it. 

rhe proper time to plan existing cities as 
a whole has passed, but we can plan the 
portion that is likely to be built upon in 
the next forty or fifty years. Up to the 
present most cities have been developed 
anyhow. When Dr. Brown asked the little 
girl “Who made you?” she said, “God made 
me so far,” indicating her baby stature, 
“and I grew the rest myself.” The same 
may be said of many of our American cities 
They have been endowed by Providence 
with beautiful sites and might be said to 
have grown the rest themselves. But the 
analogy is imperfect—for the child, like all 
natural things, but unlike the city, was the 
conscious design of its Maker, fashioned 
so as to grow up in symmetry and to de 
velop along certain decreed lines. Some 
folks say that a city must be allowed to 
grow and you cannot control its growth: 
ut cities are not really growths at all, for 
proper growth follows the lines of some 
plan; witness the tree or the child in nature 
What our cities really do is to expand or 
bulge out by accretion.

216 THE AMERICAN CITY 


Town Planntng and Housing 

In Britain we have found from long ex 
perience that it is futile to destroy slums 
unless you find some means to rehouse thosc¢ 
who now live in them. In both Britain 
and America the evil has become too deeply 
rooted to be remedied by mere regulation 

It may be claimed that those who live 
in slums do not want better conditions, but 
in practice it is found that improved envi- 
ronment converts the men and women of 
the slum into decent and responsible citi- 
zens. 

When we allow a slum race to be created 
in our midst, we cannot expect to reform 
them suddenly merely by altering their con- 
ditions. Nature demands compensation for 
any lack of foresight and indifference in 
the past; and when once people become ha- 
bituated to slums, we have to allow time 
for them to improve. The state must take 
a share of the responsibility during the 
period of transition. Socialism or not, it 
is the duty of the state to help to heal the 
sores it has allowed to be made in the body 
politic; national money, advice and super- 


vision are essential. It is true that in sani- 
tary matters much is due to individual irre- 
sponsibility and ignorance. A Scotch min- 
ister once asked his man John if it would 
not be better for him to give up drinking 
liquor. “Do you nicht take a drappie your- 
self, minister?” asks John. “Yes, but cir- 
cumstances differ.” “Very true, sir,” says 
John, “but can you tell me how the streets 
of Jerusalem were kept so clean?” “No, 
John.” “Well, sir, it was just because 
everyone kept his own door clean.” 

No doubt much of the trouble of street 
and back-yard cleaning could be improved 
by individual care, and more regulation is 
needed in these respects. But apart from 
sanitary matters the individual has little 
power and no responsibility. We must ac- 
cept the fact that the responsibility for 
planning our cities, for improving housing 
conditions and removing the slums rests 
with the governing authorities and the busi- 
ness men of our cities. We have to pay for 
past neglect even if in doing so we have to 
sacrifice some of our theories regarding in- 
dividual liberty and what we call the func- 
tions of government. 





To Increase Birmingham’s Revenue 


The city of Birmingham, Ala., has a tax 
rate, fixed by the Constitution, of $1.00 per 
hundred. Of this amount, the Constitution 
requires that one-half shall be set aside for 
payment of interest on bonds and for a 
sinking fund. The result of these restric- 
tions has been the accumulation by Bir- 
mingham of a deficit, which is now about 
$1,000,000. 

To work out a solution of this serious 
problem of municipal finance, a committee 
of 100 representative citizens was appointed 
by the Board of Commissioners. Sub- 
committees on expenditure and on tem- 
porary and permanent financial relief were 
named, and have now rendered carefully 
considered reports. Little was found to 
criticise in the present administration of the 
city’s affairs. Indeed, the report on ex- 
penditares states that “if the public desire 
the continued development of all the present 
municipal departments, they must furnish 
more money rather than retrench; for none 
of them can be run much more economi- 
cally and still justify their existence.” 

The real problem, therefore, is to secure 
additional revenue. The plan finally adopted 


seems to be very elastic and comprehensive. 
It provides for a maximum tax rate of 
$1.50, which shall be referred to the people 
every two or three years. If more funds 
are provided by equalization, or raise of 
assessments, or by taking some of the 
county’s money, or what-not, the city rate 
can be automatically decreased by a vote of 
the people. 

In order that the governmental authori- 
ties shall not embark on improvements that 
the people do not approve, the budget must 
be submitted to them and approved before 
the tax rate can go into effect. 

If the governmental authorities exceed 
the budget, or spend money not authorized, 
they are subject to impeachment and re- 
moval from office. 

At the same time, a plan of equalization 
will be provided to head off the backsliders 
on low assessments. 

A proposed constitutional amendment 
and a bill for enactment at the present ses- 
sion of the Legislature, embodying its 
recommendations, have been prepared by 
the committee and are included in its 
report. 


Departmental Reporting for Cities and Counties

of Indexing

correct data, the method used in pre- 

senting it is usually of equal importance. 
Unfortunately, this fact is seldom realized. 
The old saying that “facts speak for them- 
selves” is to a considerable extent not true. 
To serve best the purpose for which data 
are compiled, they should be properly mar- 
shaled and presented in an effective manner. 

As the eye conveys to the mind a descrip 
tion of a scene much more quickly from a 
picture than from a written description of 
the scene, so it is that one grasps the sig- 
nificance of a fact more quickly when the 
graphic method of presentation is used. It 
is the application of this principle which 
has revolutionized the advertising field in 
recent years. Instead of being merely de- 
scribed, commodities for sale have been put 
before the public mind by catchy pictures, 
their strong points being emphasized in the 
pictures. So it is in report writing: the 
strong points, the most significant features, 
should be played up so as to arrest atten- 
tion. This may be done by the use of fact 
pictures commonly called 
graphs or graphic charts. 

There is special need for 
such fact pictures in admin- 
istrative reports because as a 
class they have the reputa- 
tion of being dry, uninterest- 
ing reading. So it is sug- 
gested that, having prepared 
the tabular statements for a 
report, they be carefully 
studied to ascertain just 
which facts stated therein are 
the most important, and hav- 
ing determined this informa- 
tion, such facts be set forth 
in graphic form. 

Graphic charts can be 
most easily prepared on 
cross section paper. In the 
style of graph most common- 
ly used each sectional margin 
of the chart, both perpendicu- 


[correct dat as is the compilation of 


lar and horizontal, is made to represent a 
definite unit of measure, the vertical sec- 
tional margins representing one kind of 
unit measure and the horizontal margins 
another. One or more heavy lines are then 
drawn across the cross sections in such a 
way that the direction thereof indicates the 
quantity measured. For example, in chart 
No. I, shown herewith, each vertical mar- 
ginal section represents a unit value of five 
cents and each horizontal marginal section 
a time unit of one month. 
the line shows at

that the 
stable cost per horse day working was re 
duced from $1.30 in January, 1912, 
cents in October, 1913. It also shows that 
after that time the tendency was upward. 
This upward tendency latterly would ob 
viously call for an explanation by the per- 
son in charge of the stable. 

Although this style of chart may be elab- 
orated with two or more lines showing as 
many different kinds of facts, a word of 
caution is necessary lest 
done.

that when such graphs contain more than 
three charted lines they are read by none 
but the person who makes them. The most 
easily read graph is, of course, that con- 
taining only one charted line. When it is 
desired to include facts or conditions which 
will require more than three lines, an addi- 
tional graph should be prepared. 

Our observation has been that engineers 
and other technicians are particularly prone 
to use involved and complex graphs. Al 
though the significance of such may be 
readily comprehended by them, the enthu- 
siasm of preparation and the technical 
training of their own minds lead them to 
forget that the average reader will not 
grasp the essentials with equal facility. The 
very fact that the use of graphs has been 
confined largely to reports of technical de- 
partments, and as a result graphs have to 
a great extent been of the complex type, 
has tended to discourage a more general 
use of the graphic method of presentation. 

Hundreds and probably thousands of 
facts lend themselves naturally to presenta 
tion in line graphs as described. This 
method is used most to picture facts histor- 
ically over an extended period. 

There are other facts which may be set 
forth more clearly by other styles of 
graphs. For example, the circle or dial 
form is useful in showing relative compari- 
son of existing conditions or to set forth 
proportions relatively. Since a circle con- 
sists of 360 degrees, it is easy to divide it 
into several segments which, by the number 
of degrees contained in each, will illustrate 
several different conditions. An illustration 
of the usefulness of this style of graph is 
afforded by chart No. 2. 





FRONTAGE RATES 


— %o 







=e Ye 





NOT REINSPECTED 






Another style of graph which lends itself 
well to the presentation of relative propor- 
tions comprehends the use of parallel lines, 
cubes, rectangles or cylinders. Whichever 
of these objects are used, they are arranged 
parallel on the same base line, either hori- 
zontal or vertical, and the lengths are made 
to vary in the same proportion as the 
amounts, value or quantities they represent. 
(See Chart No. 3.) 

Many rules may be laid down for the 
preparation of graphic charts, but the fol- 
lowing, when considered supplemental to 
what has already been stated herein, will 
probably be sufficient: 


1—State the title of the chart so clearly that 
misunderstanding will be impossible. 

2—The general arrangement should be from 
left to right. However, the vertical scale 
should read from bottom to top. 


3—The data on which the chart is based 
should be included therein whenever possible. 


4—The zero or basic scale should be shown 
whenever possible. When it is not shown, a 
broken, wavy line may be used to indicate that 
the remaining portion has been dropped. 


The use of photographs in reports is much 
abused. This is manifest mostly in the cus- 
tom of many public officials to publish por- 
traits of themselves in their annual reports. 
The uselessness of such adornment in a re-+ 
port, the additional cost, the unjustifiable 
increase in size, as well as the very bad 
taste which it evidences, are all so obvious 
as to need no discussion herein. 

We would lay down no rule with respect 
to the use of photographs, but simply em- 
phasize that they should be used only after 
careful deliberation so as to be sure that 
such use is justified. Some photographs tell

a story most forcibly—more so, in fact, than 
any other medium. Others are merely dec-

omitted. 


General Style 


Although the content of a report, is the 
thing to be emphasized, efficient reporting 
also comprehends careful attention/ 
factors as size and shape of the 
styles of type, arrangement of capt 
quence of contents, quality of paper§, bind- 
ing, etc. 

Many reporting officers seek to give 
prominence to their reports by making them 
unusual in shape. They do not realize that 
such reports often defeat their own object, 
because the unusual and clumsy size causes 
them to be thrown aside into piles of other 
miscellaneous ill-shaped reports or even 
into the waste basket, instead of being filed 
for reading and reference. The first requi- 
site should be conformity with the size and 
shape of reports of the same department for 
prior years, so as to preserve a uniformity 
of files. If any change is made from the 
size of prior years, it should be to adopt a 
new standard, and the latter should then be 
adhered to each year thereafter. In estab- 
lishing such new standard, the two main 
points to be kept in mind are a size large 
enough and yet not too large for which the 
paper can be cut without waste, or at least 
with a minimum of waste, from the stand 
ard size sheets of the paper manufacturer. 
The waste of paper in trimming to con- 
form to special sizes is often lost sight of, 
not only when reporting, but also when de- 
vising new forms of accounting records.

ATIONS, DEPARTMENT OI! 


rhe writer has in mind one instance where 
$1,200 was saved in the cost of installing 
a new accounting system in a city depart- 
ment by simply making all the new blanks 
conform to the standard commercial sizes 
of paper and thereby eliminating all waste 
in cutting. 

Paper comparatively light in weight is 
preferable to the heavy weights. It makes 
a report less bulky and therefore easier to 
handle, as well as cheaper to mail. The 
plain natural finish is in better taste than 
the enameled. A report printed on heavy 
enameled paper immediately conveys an im- 
pression to the reader that the official re 
sponsible for it is similafly lavish in other 
ways and does not practice the economy 
expected of a public officer. 

With the abandonment of high-priced 
paper should go all leather bindings and 
gold-leaf lettering. They bespeak wasteful- 
ness rather than economy; vain show and 
gaudiness rather than real efficiency. The 
best way is to bind half of the order in 
heavy paper and the other in cloth, and only 
give the cloth-covered volumes to a special 
mailing list. 

It is equally bad to use too large or too 
small type. Do not leave the selection of 
type entirely to your printer. Have him 
come to your office with a book of samples. 
so that you can advise together with all the 
at hand. It is important that one 
select the best size and style of type, not 
only for the text matter of the report, but 
also for each of the several kinds of head- 
ings, footnotes, etc. A report to be read 
must be easy to read. Such definite stand- 
ards should be established that each kind of

heading will be differentiated by a specific 
size and style of type. It is customary for 
many report writers and printers also to 
set up a heading in the form of an inverted 
pyramid—each successive line being shorter 
than that preceding. li the headings are 
lengthy, this form occupies from two to 
three times the space that would otherwise 
be required. The purpose is to give promi- 
nence to headings. However, this may be 
achieved without loss of space by setting 
the headings full width of the type page but 
using a heavier-faced type than for the text 
matter. Moreover, such type, commonly 
known as “black-faced,”” may be used in 
different sizes of both upper and lower case, 
so as actually to improve the appearance of 
the report. One of the most informative 
as well as the most attractive reports the 
writer has seen is that of the London (Eng- 
land) County Council. The style of head- 
ings here suggested is used therein. 

In arranging the sequence of contents, 
endeavor should be made to place the tabu- 
lar statements, charts, etc., near to the text 
matter to which they respectively relate. 
There will, of course, be occasional tabular 
statements detailed in character and data of 
a supporting or reference character which 
can best serve their purpose by being placed 
at the back of the report as an appendix— 
reference being made thereto from the pre- 
ceding portions of the report. However, in 
the majority of cases it is of advantage to 
the reader to have the text matter, tables 
and charts which relate to the same subject 
all located together. It is very discour- 
aging in report reading to be compelled to 
turn back and forth among the pages in 
order to assemble the several related parts 
of a given subject 

The most important point to remember, 
in arranging the sequence of contents, is 
to place the most important and salient fea- 
tures first; yet this is seldom done. For 
example, the prime object for maintaining 
health departments is to reduce the death 
and morbidity rates. Naturally one would 
expect to find statements relative thereto 
and also other vital statistics at the very 
beginning of a health officer’s report, yet it 


frequently is at the very back. As the 
profit and loss account is of first interest 
to the stockholders of a private corporation, 
just so is a succinct statement of the chief 
results obtained during the year of first 
interest to the citizens of a community 
(public corporation). A water report 
should show first the increased or de- 
creased consumption per capita and the in- 
creased or decreased cost per thousand gal- 
lons; a street cleaning department, the in- 
creased or decreased area cleaned and cost 
per ten thousand square yards; a depart- 
ment collecting refuse, the same kind of 
data with respect to the quantity collected 
and cost per ton mile; a sewer cleaning bu- 
reau, the same with respect to quantity of 
solid matter removed and cost per cubic 
yard; an institution, the number of patient 
or inmate days and cost per patient or in- 
mate day; a police department, the number 
of complaints, arrests and convictions by 
classes of crime, etc. 

Not only should such information be 
placed first because it is of the most impor- 
tance and is the information sought first 
by the public, but also because it will at- 
tract the attention of the reader and en- 
courage him to read subsequent pages of 
the report. Finally, it is the logical se- 
quence to state the important and summary 
facts first and then proceed to support each 
by detail tables and descriptive matter. 


Indexing the Report 

Having prepared a report and obtained 
page proof thereof from the printer, the 
next step is to compile a comprehensive in- 
dex. The failure adequately to index a 
report is fatal to its usefulness. Indexing 
can be done most easily by the use of cards 
or small, narrow slips of paper, on each 
of which is written only one line of the 
index. These cards or slips can be prepared 
according to the sequence of the report by 
a single but very careful reading, and sub- 
sequently assembled alphabetically. The 
last step is to have them listed by a type- 
writer copyist, as per the final arrange- 
ment. The index is then complete and 
ready for the printer.

HE civic beautification idea has ex- 
isted in Lafayette for a number of 
years. As is the case in so many of 

our smaller cities, however, the ideals of 
community betterment along esthetic lines 
were somewhat vague and_ ill-defined. 
Practical methods were not well under- 
stood, and, in fact, the whole idea of civic 
beautification rested in the minds of a com 
paratively few leaders and was not the 
common property of the majority of citi- 
zens. 

It was difficult to make any real progress 
toward carrying out a definite program, or 
to make any strong popular appeal, because 
there was no organization to assume def- 
inite leadership and responsibility. Some 
kind of organization is essential to serve 


as a focal point in centering popula 
thought for any collective action on civic 
problems. It is also almost axiomatic tha 
such an organization should be non-polit 
ical. 

Lafayette “found itself” in the formati 
of a chamber of commerce. This body 
organized along the broadest possible lines 
the basic article of its creed being that 
nothing of interest to Lafayette was for 
eign to it. 

It is not the purpose of this report t 
review the manifold activities of this rey 
resentative body of citizens nor fo dwel 
on the quickening influence that was 
immediately in a score of channels of com 
munity life. It is only necessary to say that

[221]

222 THE AMERICAN CITY 


of the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce the 
interest in this subject, undirected and in- 
definite as it formerly had been, at once 
found a channel for effective expression. 

The yard improvement work for 1914 
was definitely started at an open meeting 
of the Civic Beautification Committee. 
This meeting was given publicity by the 
papers, and a general invitation to attend 
was extended through the press to all citi 
zens interested in the subject of the meet 
ing. Some general plans for yard improve- 
ment work were discussed informally at 
this time, and a sub-committee of the Civic 
Beautification Committee was appointed 
with the specific responsibility of organiz- 
ing and carrying out a yard improvement 
movement. The work was so planned and 
carried out by this sub-committee that &2>5 
entries were registered, or about one yard 
in six in a city of 5,000 homes. 


How the Work Was Organized 


When the sub-committee was appointed 
the chairman was named, and to him was 
assigned the work of organizing the com- 
mittee and planning the work. This com- 
mittee organization was formed very delib- 
erately. Only those were asked to serve 
who were known to be thoroughly inter- 
ested and who were in a position to give 
time and thought to the work on hand. 
Meetings were held weekly on Monday 
evenings. They were brief or protracted 
as the business in hand demanded, but they 
were held regularly and attended loyally, 
which was largely responsible for the effec 
tiveness of the preliminary work. 

The Yard Improvement Committee at 
this time consisted of but four persons: 
the chairman, two ladies prominent in club, 
social and philanthropic activities of the 
city, and a local florist of sound judgment, 
long experience and public-spirited point 
of view. 

This committee of four immediately be- 
gan a survey of similar work done in other 
parts of the country, and carried on con- 
siderable correspondence with those in 
charge of home gardening and yard im- 
provement enterprises. Little information 
was obtainable which seemed to bear di- 
rectly on the immediate problem. From 
the inception of the movement the local 
papers were systematically furnished with 


short articles emphasizing the community 
advantages to be derived from civic beau- 
tification, and through the generous co- 
operation of the press a general and wide- 
spread interest in the movement was rap- 
idly developed. 

The committee had not proceeded far in 
the plans before it was evident that some 
method must be devised for reaching di- 
rectly and personally all the citizens of the 
city who might be interested in the yard 
improvement work. To this end the city 
was divided into five districts of approxi- 
mately equal population, and a leader was 
selected to have direct supervision of the 
work in each district. The Women’s Coun- 
cil and the various clubs were interested 
through these district leaders, and thus the 
general interest continually being height- 
ened by the press publicity was further 
strengthened. The district leaders were 
selected with the same care which guided 
the first organization of the committee, and 
were at once asked to act with the com- 
mittee in developing further plans, attend- 
ing all meetings, etc. Rules for the contest 
were carefully formulated, a list of plants 
was selected for special adaptability in 
producing prompt results in yard im- 
provement, descriptions of the plants were 
worked out, directions were prepared for 
vard planting and arrangement, and all this 
material, as well as a score card for judg- 
ing yards and a registration blank for the 
contest, was published in bulletin form by 
the Chamber of Commerce. 

Meanwhile each district leader was act- 
ing as chairman of a committee of his own 
selection and completing plans for a per- 
sonal house-to-house registration canvass. 
Fach district was subdivided by the district 
leader, and a definite area was given to 
certain helpers. It was the duty of each of 
these helpers to distribute the bulletin of 
information and the registration blank to 
all householders in his territory, to explain 
the purpose of the yard improvement work, 
and enlist the active codéperation and sup- 
port of all citizens. Meanwhile timely ar- 
ticles were given the papers, with informa- 
tion as to the progress of the work, its 
meaning, etc. The rules and plant lists and 
dates of registration were published sev- 
eral times. The slogans for the campaign 
were “A cleaner, greener city,” and “Do it 
for Lafayette.”

The Progress of the Work 


With this organization the canvass was 
completed within a week and, as indicated 
above, 825 entries were secured. The 
pamphlet announced that prizes would be 
awarded the yards receiving the highest 
score, but the amount and distribution of 
the prizes was withheld for decision and 
announcement later. Many of those sign 
ing registration blanks informed the dis- 
trict workers that they were not interested 
in the competitive feature of the work, but 
wished to enter to give their definite sup- 
port to the movement. Such non-competing 
entrants were designated on the cards. 

Several minor plans were worked out 
to lend interest or to increase the value of 
the work. A collection of lantern slides 
was made, illustrating most of the plants 
recommended in the bulletin, the results of 
yard improvement work, good and bad 
taste in arrangement of yard planting, etc. 
These slides were used in a series of illus- 
trated lectures given in the various districts 
by the chairman of the committee. The co 
operation of the proprietors of the moving 
picture shows was also secured, and small 
sets of slides with appropriate explanatory 
legends were lent to each and used by each 
in rotation, without charge to the com- 
mittee. 

One of the local papers was interested in 
a photograph contest for which it offered 
$25 in prizes for the best pictures of yards 
entered in the yard improvement contest 
\nother paper was interested in an essay 
contest and offered $50 in prizes for the 
best essays giving an account of the work 
done and the results achieved in the im- 
provement of yards entered in the contest. 
Rules for these contests were prepared by 
the committee. 

rhe committee also made several camera 
tours early in the season and prepared illus- 
trated articles for the local press calling 
attention to good and bad conditions in the 
town. Through the interest thus aroused 
and through the codperation of the city ad 
ministration definite results were achieved 
in stopping the dumping of refuse on va- 
cant lots, etc., and the interest in a clean 
city increased. 

The coéperation of the Board of Public 
Works was secured, and space was set aside 
in the City Park for the use of the com- 
mittee. Beds were laid out and planted 


THE AMERICAN CI7Y¥ 


with the annuals recommended in the plant- 
ing lists published early in the spring. 
Seeds only were used, and, although some 
drawbacks were encountered, the beds fur- 
nished a very interesting and educational 
display through the summer, showing what 
could be accomplished through the use of 
easily grown annuals at a very small ex- 
pense for seed. The plants in these beds 
were labeled so that visitors could identify 
them for future use in yard planting. 


Results and Rewards 

When the registration was completed, the 
committee was confronted with two prob- 
lems—premiums and judging. It had been 
the first intention to make a canvass for 
donations to the premium list. When the 
matter was presented to the directors of 
the Chamber of Commerce and the situation 
was explained, that body very kindly ap- 
pointed a committee from its own member- 
ship to make such a canvass, and, further 
than that, guaranteed the total amount 
veeded for cash premiums. Some generous 
private donations had been made previously 
on the initiative of the donors, and the 
Chamber of Commerce pledged sufficient 
additional to bring the total to $250. A 
sweepstakes cash premium of $25 was of- 
fered for the highest scoring yard in the 
contest, and in addition $45 in cash, divided 
into ten premiums, was offered in each of 
the five districts. 

lt had been decided early in the season 
to score each competing yard three times, 
once each in June, July and August, no 
two scorings to be made less than two 
weeks apart. The Chamber of Commerce, 
feeling that the work was proving of value 
to the city, granted the request of the com- 
mittee for a paid judge to put in full time 
on the yard improvement work for the three 
ummer months. A graduate of the Horti- 
cultural Department of Purdue University 
Was employed. 

The employing of this judge was one of 
the most important steps in making the 
whole work most effective, as it enabled the 
committee to extend the yard improvement 
work in several directions. In connection 
with the inspection and scoring it was an- 
nounced through the press that the expert 
service of the judge was free to any citi- 
zen of the community in need of suggestion 
and advice on yard problems, no distinction 
being made between those entered in the

yard contest and others. <A large number 
of special visits were thus made and direc- 
tions given for the control of garden pests, 
fruit and shade tree insect enemies 
diseases, etc. 

Another valuable development of the 
\yofk»was the survey made by the yard im 
provement judge, under the direction of 
the committee, of the most serious 


and 


tree 
pests which are threatening the life of the 
shade and fruit trees of the community. A 
report on San José scale was made by the 
chairman at the request of the Chamber ot 
Commerce, and a plan was. outlined for 
controlling this and other pests and at the 
same time of putting the yard improvement 
work on a permanent basis. 

This plan, in brief, involves the coopera 
tion of the city and the school authorities. 
The value of school garden work, of which 
yard improvement work is properly a sub 
division, is being recognized in continually 
increasing degree by many of the most ad 
vanced communities in the country. The 
plan proposed is to employ a horticultural 
expert to have charge of the agricultural 
instruction and school garden work in the 
city’s new vocational school; to have this 
expert employed on a twelve months’ basis 
and paid partly by the city; to give him 
responsibility, in connection with summer 
school garden work, for the protection of 
the city trees from destruction by pests 
and to make it possible through his office 
for the people of the city to have thorough 
spraying done under competent direction, 
and thus stop the present wholesale destruc 
tion being worked by scale and other pests. 

In summary it may be said that the sea- 
son’s work was successful. Through the 
bulletin, the press, and, most of all, through 
the personal work of the helpers in each 
district, every person was directly reached 
by the work of the committee. A definite 
response was secured from nearly a thou 
sand homes, a surprisingly large propor- 
tion. 

An all summer competition was followed 
through, in spite of dry weather, by nearly 
300. While this is a considerable shrinkage 
from the number registered, yet it is really 
a large number for a contest of this kind in 
a city of the population of Lafayette. The

achievement, with a total of about 325 con-

teels that the

most lasting. The idea of civic beautifica 
tion has been, to a certain extent, popular

interested in ideals of civic improvement 
and whose minds are receptive for more 
far-feaching work along this line may now

Suggestions for the Coming Year 

Certain suggestions which were included 
in the report of the judge of the contest 
will be followed in the contest in 1915. 

\ common remark to the inspector was, 
“You should have seen my yard in the 
spring!” It seems, therefore, that it would 
be more satisfactory if inspections could 
be made in late April and early May. The 
yards are in their dress of spring bloom 
then, and it is just at this time that the 
advice of an expert is most needed and that 
it will be most efficient. A September in- 
spection would also be desirable, for then 
the prettiest fall flowers are in bloom 
ren, too, the plants are being put away 
for winter and the competitor wants the 
advice and knowledge of an expert. In 
view of these facts, it is suggested that 
May, July and September inspections be 
made, instead of those in June, July and 
\ugust. 

For greatest efficiency in civic beauti- 
fication work it is necessary to involve the 
schcols. The slovenly citizen who neglects 
his yard is not an impressionable object 
when worked upon directly, but may often 
be reached through the children. The finest 
and biggest step a civic beautification com- 
mittee may take is to interest the school 
authorities in the work and finally make it a 
school department.

growth in late May or early June, and if 
this has begun, planting should be _post- 
poned until August or September, when the 
new growth will be sufficiently hardened. 
If stock is received late in the season and 
shows any amount of new growth, it should 
be sprayed frequently and shaded; other- 
wise, failure is almost certain when the 
growth is of any length. 

Fall planting can often be continued in 
October and November; indeed, the writer 
has seen successful plantings made in De- 
cember, when weather conditions have 
been unusually favorable. In general, how- 
ever, it is well to plant in early autumn 
while the ground is still warm, so that the 
plants can become well established before 
freezing weather begins. When an August 
or September drought continues through 
October and into November, it is unwise 
to attempt planting before the next spring, 
but when moisture conditions are satisfac- 
tory, fall planting is highly recommended 


Method of Planting 

As soon as the stock is received, whether 
it is in cases or, as in carload shipments, 
loose in bulk, the plants should be unpacked, 
except in dry, windy weather, when the 
unpacking should be deferred until the ear- 
liest suitable day. If the trees cannot be 
promptly planted, they should be -put in a 
cool and shady place, and the roots should 
be protected with a covering of moist soil. 
Irreparable injury may be caused by ex- 
posing the roots for any length of time to 
a strong, dry wind, and planting under such 
weather conditions should be avoided. 

When the plants are dug up at the nur 
sery a good ball of earth should surround 
the roots, which should be further protected 
with a covering of burlap. All leading 
growers do this, except with small-sized 
trees, but it is well to have it understood in 
making arrangements. The excavation for 
planting should be at least three or four 
times as large as the root ball and about a 
foot deeper. If the soil is poor—such as a 
heavy, binding clay, a light sand or gravel 
—it should be replaced with a good loam. 
If loam is not readily available, a liberal 
mixture of well-rotted manure, preferably 
cow manure, with the poor soil will par 
tially take the place of loam. It is well to 
prepare soil for spring planting in the pre- 
vious fall, or for fall planting in the pre- 
ceding spring. Heavy clay soil can be 


THE AMERICAN CITY 229 


lightened by the addition of sand. The 
mixture of manure with soil of good quality 
is not to be recommended. When a liberal 
excavation is made and the soil is broken 
up as fine and smooth as possible and filled 
in around the roots in a greater quantity 
than is immediately needed, a highly culti- 
vated area is thus made available for the 
plant's future growth—a deep, mellow bed 
in which the new roots will find nourish 
ment. 

The mistake of too deep or too shallow 
planting is sometimes made. The soil 
mark on the tree indicates the depth at 
which the tree was planted at the nursery 
and serves as a guide for the new planting 
lhe top of the earth ball should be placed 
slightly below the ground level, and the soil 
should be then filled in and well packed or 
firmed—a very important matter. The soil 
returned before the plant is set, to creat 
the proper planting level, should also be 
well firmed, although not 
packed. If the soil is dry, a liberal amount 


necessarily 
of water should be poured in and allowed 
to settle before the rest of the soil is filled 
in. Some planters always do this, for it 
not only helps to pack the soil, but pro- 
vides necessary moisture which lasts for 
some time after the planting. When the 
entire planting operation is completed, it is 
well to form a shallow basin of soil around

the tree where rains. will accumulate and be 
taken up slowly by the ground underneath 
\ mulching of well-rotted manure or other 
matter will help to conserve the moisturs 
and prevent the soil from crusting. If a 
period of very dry weather follows th 
planting, the tops and foliage of the tre 
ought to be thoroughly sprayed every eve 
ing during the drought until the mn 
growth appears. After spring planting, the 
critical period seems to be up to about 

1; after that, if the plants show a ne 
growth or are in good healthy color, they 
are likely to thrive 


Advantages of Evergreens 


Che liberal use of the various evergreen 
species in landscape and ornamental treat 
ment affords many pleasing contrasts and 
effects. When judiciously arranged as to 
their ultimate height at maturity, they make 
a beautiful blending of form and color 
against a background of various deciduous 
trees, and when the other trees are reduced 
to winter bareness the evergreens brighten 
the landscape. Even when covered with a 


EV ERGREE)D 


\ 


S ALONG PARK WALK 


mantle of snow they make a pleasing pic 


ture 

In planting boulevards or street parkings, 
evergreens can be used advantageously 
singly or in groups in the open spaces in 
shade tree alignments. Where a parking is 
carried out in the center of an avenue, they 
can be planted as individual specimens or 

conjunction with shrubbery in the va 
rious borders, etc. The dwarf forms should 
be used for this purpose, and the shrubbery 
should be carefully pruned from time to 
time to prevent it from getting out of 
bounds. 


Desirable Types 

Evergreens may be considered in three 
classes: the dwarf and medium forms for 
more or less restricted planting, such as the 
Retinosporos, Thuyas, junipers, yews, etc. ; 
the larger forms, such as spruce, pine, fir, 
etc., for extensive areas; and those forms 
particularly adapted to screening hillside 
covers, etc. There is an almost endless 
variety of the first class, including several 
of the dwarf pines and spruces—Pinus 
Mugho, Pinus Cembra, Pinus Koriensis, 








ren 











THE AMERICAN 


Picea Gregoriana, Picea Pumila, Picea 
Pygmea, etc. They are seen to best advan 
tage in borders or groups, and are indis 
pensable for certain effects. In the pine 
family special mention should be made of 
Pinus Austriaca, a quick grower, valuable 
in exposed hilly situations; Pinus Strobus, 
one of the best under general conditions, 
and Pinus Sylvestris, especially suitable for 
windbreaks. Pinus Excelsa, Pinus Resi- 
nosa and Pinus Rigida are also excellent 
species. Among the spruces, perhaps the 
Norway spruce (Abies Excelsa) is the uni- 
versal favorite. Several other types, how- 
ever, are much to be preferred, such as the 
white spruce (Picea Alba) and the orien- 
tal spruce (Picea Orientalis), each being 
similar to Excelsa, but a much better form 
and very hardy. Particular reference 
should be made to the following excellent 
forms: Picea Pungens, Pungens Glauca and 
Kosteriana, also Abies Engelmanni, Doug- 
lasii, Concolor, Nordmanniana and Pecti 
nata, affording a wide range of color and 
form. Some of these, especially Douglasii, 
require a deep, open soil to develop prop- 
erly. 

Our ever popular native hemlock, Tsuga 
Canadensis, is one of the leading and most 
useful types. Its general adaptability, 
graceful form and rapid growth place it in 
the forefront of the ev ergreen species. For 
windbreaks, for screen planting, as indi 
vidual specimens, or grouped with other 
types, and even for hedge planting, where 
it can be sheared to a dense form, it is in- 





CITY 231 


lispensable. 


lina hemlock, is a distinct form of this 


lsuga Carolinaensis, or Caro 


variety from the Carolina mountains, and 
an excellent addition of recent introduction 

For exceptional soil conditions, wher: 
ordinarily few evergreens can be grow! 
the following should be mentioned: Pinus 
Banksiana, especially adapted to dry, loos« 
soil and capable of withstanding extreme 
drought; Pinus Sylvestris, often used 
windbreaks and in sand dune situations t 
prevent drifting; Pinus Thunbergii, in 
poorest soils; Pinus Flexilis, for rocky 
slopes For specific help where extreme 
planting problems exist, correct informa

Evergreen Shrubs 

[he shrubs that combine the advantages 
of evergreen foliage throughout the year 
and gorgeous and varied coloring during 
the blooming period make a perennial dis- 
play. The hybrid Rhododendron, native 
Rhododendron, Kalmias, Andromedas, sev- 
eral forms of evergreen azaleas, etc., form 
a splendid group and an exceedingly useful 
one when certain effects are desired. For 
woodland borders or shady situations where 
little else will be found effective, they are a 
welcome addition. It is not necessary, 
however, to confine them to such situations ; 
when proper borders are prepared and a 
liberal mulching applied from time to time, 
they can be successfully grown in more or 


less open places

Selection of Khododendron types should

hardy in this country, among which are the 
following: Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dick-

Lady Armstrong, Mrs. Milner, Purpureun

where the high coloring of the mor 
expensive hybrid sorts is not necessary. 
hese are collected from their native habi 
tat and can be purchased at reasonable 
prices from leading nurserymen by the cat 
load or in smaller lots. 

here is a mistaken belief that Rhodo 
dendrons will not stand severe winter co 
ditions. In their native state they are usu 
ally found in high and severe altitudes, no 
tably in our own Allegheny ranges and in 
the Himalayas or northern India. A south- 
ern exposure should always be avoided; it 
is not the cold, but the continued freezing 
and thawing suffered by plants so placed, 
that results in their destruction. Most of 
the suggestions regarding coniferous ever- 
greens apply to evergreen shrubs. The 
shrubs require a rich fibrous loam, with a 
liberal, but not excessive, use of peat, leaf 
mould or other vegetable humus. Plenty 
of rich top sod, dug into the border and 
allowed to rot down well before planting is 
done, will supply the needed vegetable 
humus. Prepare the ground, if possible, a 
season ahead of planting. The presence of 
lime or chalk in the soil will prove fatal 
to Rhododendrons. 

Border planting is much to be preferred 


THE AMERICAN CITY 


to individual planting. A good watering 
just after planting and before mulching is 
applied is desirable. Nearly all the ever- 
green shrubs carry a fine root fiber very 
near the surface of the soil, and mulching 
is therefore essential. It is also especially 
necessary to avoid all digging of the soil 
or heavy hoeing of the border after plant- 
in Weeds should be pulled out or de- 
stroyed with as little disturbance of the soil 
as possible. The writer has seen many ex 
cellent borders and Rhododendron planta- 
tions practically ruined—in one case in a 
leading park system—through ignorance of 
this fundamental rule. 

Winter protection, other than the usual 
covering of the soil with leaves, is not 
necessary for evergreen shrubs planted in 
protected places. In open situations some 


winter protection is advisable. Native 
spruce, cedar or other dense evergreen trees 
are often cut from the woods and set up 
right in the soil close together, forming a 
screen around the border. This, with 
plenty of leaves covering the soil, will pro- 
tect the plants through the most severe 
weather. 

lo anyone who has had the pleasure of 
seeing the hybrid Rhododendrons in bloom 
in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, besides the na- 


tive types and Kalmias planted there, the, 


display affords a lasting recollection and a 
splendid object lesson on what can be done 
with these varieties under many different 
conditions. 
In Conclusion 

It can be safely said that there are no 
insurmountable difficulties in the way of 
evergreen planting. In nine cases out of 
ten the trees will respond readily to ordi 
nary care and treatment. Common sense 
care will assuredly bring its reward.

Chis notice, reproduced below, is in three

For three or four years, only the first sec-

In order to assist this department in obtain-

ery way, the following suggestions are 
offered: 

Do not allow unnecessary waste water to 
flow upon the streets, which interferes with 
and delays the work, and causes unnecessary 
expense. 

Do not persist in passing “Street Closed” 
signs, as they are put up to protect the work 
and should be obeyed. 

Do not use a hose on a newly laid street, 
as the force of the water tends to tear out 
the filler between the blocks before it has 
become hardened. 

If you have a complaint to make, do not 
argue with the foreman on the work; call up 
the Paving Commission’s office, St. Paul 2000,

Competitive Bidding on Patented Pavements’ 
By George C. Warren 


NFORTUNATELY, the courts of 
some of the states at one time re- 
garded the requirement of the law 

that there should be competitive bidding in 
the letting of public contracts as prohibiting 
the use of a patented pavement or other 
article, on the theory that there could be 
no competition in bidding for that article, 
which by law was made the exclusive prop- 
erty of the owner of the patent franchise. 
It was realized, however, that this con 
struction of the law not only would result 
in keeping cities from using the latest and 
best improvements, no matter how cheap or 
necessary they might be, but also had the 
practical effect of doing indirectly what the 
state or city could not possibly do directly 
—that is, prohibit the use of a patented ar- 
ticle simply because it was patented by the 
United States Government. 

Respectable attorneys have seriously in- 
sisted, nevertheless, that the adoption of 
patented pavements by municipalities is il- 
legal, however meritorious the patented 
pavement may be, and cases along this line 
have been within the past twenty years car- 
ried to the highest courts of the states of 
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, South Caro 
lina, Oregon, Missouri, Maryland, Louis 
iana, Kentucky, Michigan, Kansas, Iowa, 
Indiana, Idaho, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Massachusetts, California, Mon- 
tana, Washington, Wisconsin and Illinois. 

With the exception of the two last named, 
the final decision in all of the states is to 
the general effect that, where the owner of 
the patent voluntarily surrenders the exclu- 
sive right which the government has given 
him in granting the patent, and offers to 
allow any contractor to use the patent by

and Specifications for Patented Pavements,” prepared

article or portion of the article covered by

the construction of the contract for

which the law requires has been provided, 
and that cities need not wait the expiration

is granted before being permitted to use it 
Under such regulations, patented pave- 
ments may be laid and contracted for by 
municipalities, and any state law which pro 
hibits the adoption of a patented pavement 
by its municipalities may be assumed to be

unconstitutional because it attempts to pre 
vent the the 
franchise based on 


exercise of Federal patent 
which is the United 
States Constitution and is therefore para- 
mount to all conflicting state laws. Of the 
two states in which decisions of the final 
courts have been adverse to patented pave- 
ments, the Wisconsin Legislature promptly 
amended its law so that patented pavements 
may be used, and Illinois stands alone as 
the only state in which there is practically 
a patent prohibition on municipal improve 
ment work. 

The courts of most of the states above 
referred to have approved the principle that 
the competition required by the state laws 


is provided if the owner of the patent files 
with the municipality a binding agreement 
under which at a certain price he will sell 
the patented portion of the pavement 


which patented portion is generally confined 
to the wearing surface—to all responsible 
bidders, so that all such bidders may com

suriace material, which he must purchase 
trom the owner of the patent at the reason 
able price which he may fix under his patent 
franchise granted by the Federal Govern 
ment. Under this plan it is important that 
the contractor should have the fullest pos- 
sible notice that 

1. The pavement or certain features of 
the pavement for which bids are invited are 
patented. 


2. The terms under which contractors 
may purchase the patented materials for use 
in the construction and the right to use the 
patents. 

Under the competition thus provided by 
proper specification, general contractors 


can purchase the patented pavement mate- 
rials combined ready for use, just as they 
purchase brick, creosoted blocks, stone 
blocks and other special unpatented surface 
paving materials from the specialized expe- 
rienced manufacturers thereof, and com- 
pete for the laying of the complete pave- 
ment without the large plant investment and 
engaging of expert service which are es- 
sential to the successful manufacture of 
such materials. 

This principle with slight modifications 
can be applied to various forms of patented 
pavements, whether the patents are con- 
fined to the wearing surface or foundation, 
or cover the entire pavement—i.e., both 
foundation and wearing surface. 





Letters to 


Garbage Collection Systems 
lo the Editor of Tue American City: 

My attention has been called to an article 
in your December number regarding a 
“New System of Garbage Collection in 
>yracuse, ey oy 

Permit me to point out that while this 
system might be “new” so far as Syracuse 
is concerned, it is not a “novel garbage 
by any means. It was

lo illustrate some of the disadvantages 
of the “exchanging cans” system, as now 
used in Syracuse, I cannot do better than 
quote a few sentences from a paper read 
in 1911 before the International Society for 
Civic Hygiene by a well-known sanitary 
engineer, Oscar Gerold, of Berlin, Ger- 
many : 

“The collecting and carrying away of refuse 
should be handled in a quick, odorless and 
dustless way. The ‘exchanging-can’ system is 
confronted with a great many disadvantages, 
not to mention the terrific noise made by these

cans. Inasmuch as the eans are lifted up with 
a swing and set down on the truck’s platform, 
it is impossible to prevent the cans from be- 
coming battered out of shape in a short time. 
The covers then will not fit and are conse- 
quently laid by the side of the cans. The cans 
suffer greatly from the unloading also, and 
are in constant need of repairs. The low 
wheels of these trucks, too, make the pulling 
hard. * * * Furthermore, the platform of 
the wagon itself is rapidly worn out by the 
constant loading up of cans and needs fre- 
quent repairs also.” 


Herr Gerold points out other disadvan- 
tages, including the transporting of partly 
filled cans, and the time and labor consumed 
in unloading at the terminal. Your article, 
indeed, bears out some of his contentions. 
inasmuch as you state that the cans in Syra-

Where Are Missouri’s Engineers? 


To the Editor of THe AMERICAN City: 


“I wanted a man of executive ability and 
honesty, familiar with the ins and outs of 
legal practice, so I have appointed Sam 
Jones, road engineer, to be Attorney-Gen 
eral,” said the Governor of a great state. 

No, that’s not what happened; but here is 
the actual occurrence as reported in the 
Kansas City Star of February 3, 1914: 


AJUDGE THE NEWSURVEYOR 


MAJOR NAMED ALLAN C. SOUTHERN 
TO SUCCEED LATE R. T. PROCTER. 


Wanted Execative on Whose Honesty 
He Could Rely, Governor Said—Ap 
pointment a Surprise to Politi- 
clans and New County Officer. 


xx kx Ke KKK KE KK K OR 


WILL OVERSEE EXPENDITURE OF BIG SUM. 

“I wanted a man of executive ability, 
upon whose honesty I could implicitly 
rely, to administer the affairs of the of- 
fice,” Governor Major said, commenting 
upon the appointment. “He will have 
the overseeing of the expenditure of 
more than a million dollars in the next 
two years and I wanted a man familiar 
With road work in Jackson County who 
could administer the office efficiently and 
see that a dollar’s worth of work is put. 
on the roads for every dollar spent, and 
that every contractor lived up to the 
letter of his contract. I have that man 
in Judge Southern.” 


The law does not require the county 
surveyor to be an engineer. It says that 
the county surveyor shall be ex-officio 
highway engineer. The requisite of a 
highway engineer is two years’ experi- 
ence in road and bridge building. As 
the county surveyor is ex-officio highway 
engineer, it was said here there was no 
doubt of the legal right of Judge South- 
ern to accept the appointment. 


Probably poor old Missouri has sent all 
her engineers to the relief of the Belgians, 
and the resourceful Governor, wishing to 
keep the straitened 
a family secret, felt he was performing a 


state’s circumstances 
great public service by appointing a lawyer 
to fill the position of County Surveyor of 
the important county in which Kansas City 
is located. 

The Governor shows the public how to 
be brave and optimistic under a trying cir- 
cumstance. His lawyer is honest and pos- 
sessed of ‘executive ability.’ What other 
qualifications could possibly be necessary 
for efficiency as County Surveyor in a sec- 
tion where a large amount of bridge design 
and road work is in progress? Besides, if 
the lawyers fail to size up to such jobs, 
Governor Major’s resources will by no 
means be exhausted. Are there not left 
the artists and the barbers, and even opera 
singers, who need employment these hard 


times? So why embarrass the engineers by 
asking them to undertake a task so ob 
viously beyond their limits of integrity and

ARCHED BRIDGI 
IN GENESEE PA 





OVER RED CREEK AT WESTFALL ROAD 
RK, ROCHESTER 


A Strong and Graceful Bridge 


BRIDGE which attracts much favor- 
A able comment from visitors t 

Genesee Valley Park, in Rochester, 
N. Y., is shown in the accompanying illus- 
tration 

This bridge was constructed in IQIO-II. 
It is built of Portland cement concrete with 
a facing of Medusa white Portland and 
crushed Barre granite. The balusters were 
made in cast iron molds and set in place, the 
hand rail being cast about the upper ends 
of said balusters. The bridge is 90 feet 
long over all and the floor has a camber of 
12 inches. The span is 48 feet and is a 
semi-ellipse with 8-foot rise. The level of 
the water shown is one foot below the 
spring line, and is the future low pool level 
of the Barge Canal, which crosses the 
Genesee River at grade near the mouth of 
this creek and but a short distance east of 
the bridge. 

The construction consists of six parallel 
arches of structural steel buried in a rib of 
concrete 16 inches thick, with floor slab and 
sidewalk slabs superposed. This sidewalk 


[240] 


) 


has a metal edge which answers for a curb, 
and a macadam pavement is carried over 
the bridge. The width of roadway is 18 
feet and the sidewalks are each 5 feet wide. 

Owing to the location, the bridge rests 
upon two piers and the shore ends of the 
bridge are, including the steel ribs, canti- 
levered over said piers. The structure is 
monolithic in that no expansion joints are 
allowed except at the ends of the hand rail 
where they enter the newel posts. 

The earth foundation received a severe 
trial in the flood which occurred March 28, 
1913. At that time only the center of the 
deck was out of water, and the bridge and 
the roadway forming its approaches held up 
the flood waters about two feet higher on 
the upstream side than on the downstream 
side. After this flood had passed it was 
found that the four corners of the bridge 
were at the same elevation and that no 
cracks had occurred despite the fact that the 
highway close to the west end of the bridge 
had been washed out for a depth of about 8 
Teet. 














Community Planning with Voluntary Restrictions 
By Robert Anderson Pope 


Specialist in the Design of Model Communities 


HEN a community begins to have a 
sense of unity, a sense of com- 
munity spirit begins also to strive 

to accomplish varied projects for 
munity welfare. 

Such was the situation in the borough 
of Narberth, Pa., a town more or less typi- 
cal of suburban communities adjacent to 
large cities, having a population of about 
2,000 people, largely residential and de- 
pendent upon its nearness to Philadelphia 
for its economic welfare. A civic associa- 
tion had been formed and its worth and 
serviceability were tested in the undertak- 
ing under its own auspices of a very beauti- 
ful and successful pageant, for which it 
received much favorable comment. Thus 
it was that the association began to look 
for other fields of useful community 
activity. 

A lecture on “Suburban Planning” by the 
secretary of the Suburban Planning Asso- 
ciation of Philadelphia, aroused the inter- 
est of the community in the possibility of 
town planning for the borough. This re- 
sulted in the appointment of a committee, 
with the president of the Narberth Civic 
Association, Mr. George Henry, as chair- 
man. A plan of procedure was determined 
upon which is believed to be unique. It 
was agreed that the community interests— 
from a town planning standpoint—would 
be greatly enhanced if the townspeople 
themselves would in some way take over 
and develop a certain tract of unimproved 
acreage that lay within the legal bounds of 
the borough. 

The plan proposed and adopted was to se- 
cure resident subscribers to the number of 
plots that would result from the designing 
of a model development such as would as- 
sign a liberal area to park and other com- 
munity purposes. The price of the lots to 
each subscriber was to be equal to the sum 
of the cost of the improvement, plus the 
proportionate share of the entire cost of 
the land. 

That this plan of procedure has proved 
practical is demonstrated by the fact that 
all but a very few of the plots have been 


com- 


subscribed for, thus providing the funds 
necessary to pay for the equity in the land, 
the cost of improvements and the profes-

having been approved and staked out on the

station and is particularly well adapted for 
the purpose for which it was chosen. It 


combines a wooded area and open fields, 
and also a_ good-sized and _ picturesque 
brook which flows between the wooded 


area and the open land. The elevations 
are also especially advantageous, for the 
land slopes on either side of the brook 
towards it, thereby providing well-drained 
elevated and extended vistas. The 
central area of the property lies in the open 
land and includes the brook on one side 
This central area has been designated as a 
permanent public park and will be deeded 
without fee to the township in exchange for 
an agreement already entered into with the 
Park Commissioners to maintain the said 
park in perpetuity. This policy has been 
determined upon for no other reason than 
the large increase in land value which will 
result to the plots facing the land desig 
nated as permanent park area; and since 
each plot in the design has a frontage on 
the public park, each plot will be benefited 
by this policy. The taboo which has been 
placed on such park provisions in other 
developments, especially those of real es- 
tate speculators, has been due largely to 
the lack of an adequate provision for the 
maintenance of such park areas, for when 
maintenance has been unprovided, as is 
usually the case, these public spaces have 
been eye-sores because of their neglect 
Other features of the design are that

Consolidation of City and County 
Government 

SACRAMENTO, CAL.—A movement to con- 
solidate the government of the city and 
county of Sacramento is under way in 
Sacramento. The consolidation is being 
urged by the Sacramento Chamber of Com- 
merce as a means of reducing the tax rate 
and promoting efficiency. Some of the 
benefits which it is hoped will accrue are 
the following: (1) It would make for gen- 
eral economy; (2) it would promote ef- 
ficiency throughout the administration of 
the city and county governments; (3) it 
would be a convenience and time-saver to 
the community in the transaction of public 
business; (4) it would place it within the 
power of the people of the city and county 
of Sacramento to determine, for example, 
the compensation of county officers, and to 
determine the number of deputies in each 
office, which things are now determined by 
the State Legislature without the know] 
edge of the people concerned, and often in 
an extravagant fashion; (5) it would give 
the consolidated city and county complete 
home rule in subjects relating to its own 
government, which makes general economy 
of government possible; and (6) it would 
provide modern instead of out-of-date 
methods and modern machinery for the 
transaction of business — 
methods as any 
come and large 
provided at the 


public such 
corporation of large in- 
expenditures would have

asked, Why continue to be extravagant by 
maintaining two sets of offices to do the 
work which one set of offices can do for 
both the city and county? 

\t the recent state election,

Consolidation Amendment, was carried 
his amendment provides the method by 
which city and county governments can be 
combined, which consists of the following 
steps: 


constitu- 


1—A board of freeholders must be elected 
with a view to framing a charter along the 
lines prescribed in Constitutional Amendment 
No. 19. 

2—The charter, when so prepared, must be 
submitted to the voters of the city and carried 
by a majority vote 

3—The charter must then be submitted to 
the voters of that portion of the county outside 
of the city limits, and there carried by a ma- 
jority vote. 

4—Upon the adoption of the charter by the 
people, the charter must be submitted to the 
State Legislature for its approval. 

It is hoped that the first three steps may 
be taken in time to have the charter ap- 
proved by the 1917 session of the Legis- 
lature.

A Notable Achievement 


\ustin, Texas—A dam across the Colo 
rado River at Austin, costing approxi 
mately $1,720,000, has just been completed. 
This improvement was brought about 
through the activity of the Austin Cham- 
ber of Commerce. The photograph here 
reproduced shows water flowing over the 
dam for the first time. The dam was 
planned primarily to provide a source of 
water supply for the city and also means 
for the transmission of electricity in and 
around Austin. A lake thirty miles long 
and a quarter of a mile wide has been 
formed thereby, combining a reservoir and 
pleasure lake. It is expected that 7,200 
horse-power will be developed for trans- 

ission by electricity.

writing contest upon the subject, “How to 
make Hamilton a better and more prosper- 
ous city.” On the evening of December 16 
the children—one thousand strong—repre- 
senting every school in the city, both pub- 
lic and parochial, in many cases accom- 
panied by their parents—gathered in the 
assembly room of the Hamilton Chamber 
of Commerce to hear talks upon their duty 
to Hamilton, to witness the distribution of 
$50 in cash prizes among their number, and 
to enjoy a Christmas treat as the guests of 
the Chamber. The prize money was di- 
vided into two classes, $25 allotted to the 
pupils of the high schools and $25 to those 
of the grammar and parochial schools. In 
the high school contest twelve prizes were

offered, varying in amount from $10 to $1 


and in the grammar and parochial school 
contest the $25 was divided into eighteen 
awards, from $10 to 50 cents. 

Every conceivable phase of Hamilton 
life was touched upon by the children, and 


many of them put their fingers with sur- 


prising accuracy upon the city’s most essen 
tial civic defects. One of the prize-winning 
essays in the high school contest—a cl

girl of sixteen years—is here given in t

Municipal Exhibit 

Evizaretu, N. J.—In the municipal ex- 
hibit recently held in Elizabeth were in- 
cluded the city departments of Education, 
Engineering, Fire, Health, Library, Play- 
grounds and Police; also the Charity Or- 
ganization Society, the Board of Trade and 
the Conference on Interurban Improve- 
ment. This last organization embraces 
representatives of many cities and com- 
munities, including Newark and Elizabeth 
and several neighboring localities, and had 
a display of several maps showing possible 
comprehensive road, park and waterway 
improvement. 

The Board of Education was represented 
by charts and photographs; the City En- 
gineering Department by maps; the Fire 
Department by models of apparatus; a map 
of the city showing distribution of com- 
panies and apparatus was displayed, an- 
other map showing location of fire-alarm 
Stations and tables of statistics. The 
Health Department showed milk charts 
and bacteriological samples. The Public 
Library, in which building the exhibit was 
held, showed books and magazines relating 
to city planning and other civic subjects, 
also sample forms used in its work. 

The Playgrounds Commission had a 
map showing distribution of playgrounds 
in the city, also an elaborate drawing of 
a playground which, it is hoped, will be 
provided on a block of city-owned prop- 
erty in one of the densely populated por- 
tions of Elizabeth. The Charity Organiza- 


tion Society showed photographs contrast- 
ing good and bad housing, and diagrams. 

The Board of Trade showed maps illus- 
trative of Elizabeth’s rail and water trans- 
portation facilities, city planning pamphlets 
and material, booklets, newspaper and 
magazine clippings, charity endorsement 
forms, trolley time-tables, clean-up and 
“Dollar Day” circulars, and various other 
forms and publicity material used in its 
work.

Unemployment 

Youncstown, On1to—The Committee on 
Unemployment of the Youngstown Cham- 
ber of Commerce is aiding in the solution 
of the problem of unemployment in that 
city by helping to connect up the man and 
the job. A newspaper article, in which the 
plans of the committee were fully discussed, 
included a coupon which persons desiring 
to give employment either to men or 
women were requested to fill out and send 
in to the Committee on Unemployment. 
The general public was urgently invited to 
coéperate with the committee by creating 
employment of every legitimate nature for 
all persons in the city in need of it. In

Child Welfare 

La Crosse, Wis.—The Committee on 
Public Health of the La Crosse Board of 
Trade raised the necessary funds to pro- 
vide the city with a school nurse and to es- 
tablish in one of the large parks of the city 
a summer camp to be open during July and 
August. To this camp mothers who are 
busy during the day can take their chil- 
dren under two years of age and let them 
remain there all day in the open air under 
expert care. It is the intention to have 
trained nurses in attendance and to furnish 
food for the babies free, this work to be 
done under the direction of the Board of 
Health. 

In the work of raising the money for the 
above purposes, only small subscriptions 
were accepted. This was done because it 
was desired to get a large number of peo- 
ple interested in the work. In four or five 
days the committee raised some $1,200, 
about two-thirds of the amount being in 
$1 or $2 subscriptions. This sum, with an 
appropriation of $250 from the city, will 
carry the work through the year.

Four Junior Chambers of 
Commerce 

Canton, Onto.—The Junior Chamber of 
Commerce which has been lately organized 
in the Central High School of Canton was 
formed for the usual purpose of developing 
civic pride and good citizenship among the 
students. This organization has a distinc- 
tive feature, however, in the large amount 
of attention which is given to vocational 
guidance. One of the principal objects of 
the organization is to connect both the 
school and the student body more closely 
with the business interests of the city, in 
order that through their acquaintanceship 
with a good live group of students the 
merchants and manufacturers will be led to 
select the recruits for their business from 
this group. 

The school has been for some time con- 
ducting also an employment bureau, and it 
has been found that the bureau has been 





Cit F 247 


able to place its services at the disposal of 
employers more effectively as a result of 
the activities of the Junior Chamber. Mr. 
Frank M. Sheldon, principal of the school 
and father of the local Junior Chamber 
movement, reports that during the last 
summer vacation the high school boys and 
girls received in wages over $21,000. 

It is expected that the members of the 
Junior organization will be assigned def- 
inite problems to handle for the senior or- 
ganization, which it is thought they are in 
many ways better fitted to handle than the 
members of the older body. It is also ex- 
pected that they will prove to be “the eyes 
of the city for civic improvement.” 

Addresses by some of the leading busi- 
ness and manufacturing men of the city are 
frequently made before the Junior Cham- 
ber, and these are followed by trips of in- 
spection to the factory or interest repre- 
sented. By these means the boys gradually 
form definite ideas along the lines of se- 
lecting their life work. 

The boys have their own committees, 
and it is said that they conduct their own 
organization with very little suggestion and 
direction. The training thus secured 
would seem to be in itself sufficient for the 
formation of a Junior Chamber. 


KNOXVILLE, TenN.—An effort to train 
young men to think in terms of civic and 
industrial betterment is being made for the 
young men of Knoxville through the Juve- 
nile Department of the Knoxville Board of 
Trade, which is under the leadership of J. 
Bailey Wray, chairman of the department. 
Boys between the ages of fourteen and 
eighteen are eligible to membership in the 
Juvenile Club. 

The club is young, having been organ- 
ized less than two months. The first work 
undertaken was that of industrial excur- 
sions. The boys were divided into groups 
of five each, one of the boys in each group 
acting as captain, and a supervisor of ma- 
ture age. having charge of each group. 
Other work undertaken by the club is that 
of collecting the dues of delinquent mem- 
bers of the senior organization. Work of 
this kind, it is thought, gives them a keen 
insight into human nature and also into 
methods of doing business. 

A plan devised by which the boys were 
able to earn money for financing the work 
of the club and which also teaches them 








os Pe PD 





a een ts, 








248 THE AMERICAN CITY 


salesmanship and independence was for 
them to undertake the sale of a product of 
a local concern for a week on a commission 
basis, the commission to be placed in the 
treasury of the club. The local concern 
offered a prize of $10 to the team selling 
the most of its product during the week. 

Other matters which it is expected that 
the boys will take up are the question of 
agitating a parks and playgrounds bond is- 
sue, a clean-up campaign, a survey of the 
city market, and the furthering of the work 
of the Beautification Committee of the 
Board of Commerce, which intends to 
launch a campaign this spring for the in- 
stallation of flower boxes in the stores of 
the merchants on the principal business 
street. 


Rome, N. Y.—The Junior Division ot the 
Reme Chamber of Comnierce is an organi- 
zation requiring no membership fee and 
open to any boy doing academic work in 
the schools of the city, parochial or public. 
Its object is to stimulate a pride in the city 
by increasing the knowledge of the indi- 
vidual regarding the facts of his home 
town and the factors which have been ef- 
fective in its growth and upbuilding. In- 
cidentally, the young men acquire a knowl- 
edge of general business and an interest in 
civic affairs which in the ordinary course 
of events would not come until long after 
they have left school. 

This division works with a committee of 
the senior Chamber, but elects its own 
officers and conducts its own affairs. For 
a long time its principal feature was a 
series of factory tours in which studies 
were made of the manufacturing plants. 
A steady and continued interest was shown 
in the workings of these industrial plants 
and quite a keen understanding was in- 
dicated in the reports written by the young 
students regarding them. When the Cham- 
ber of Commerce undertook a clean-up 
campaign, a part of the work of inspection 
and reporting fell to the juniors and was 
done in a most satisfactory manner. Their 
greatest single achievement, however, was 
in the help given at the time of the safety 
first campaign, as described in Toe Amert- 
can City for September, 1914. 

This year the Juniors felt that there 
were some other things that they would 
like to know about in addition to factories, 
and they made a request that men from 
the senior Chamber meet with them at 


stated times to discuss such subjects as 
“How Banking Is Done,” “Everyday Law,” 
‘Advertising,” “Salesmanship,” “Merchan- 
dising,” “Copper Production” and similar 
topics. 

The only limits of the activities of the 
Junior Chamber are such as the boys may 
see fit to draw. There has been consider- 
able thought of making an effort to raise 
money for a local worthy charity, and 
various matters of this kind are taken up 
and discussed in much the same way that 
the senior Chamber might consider them. 
It is not difficult to see of what benefit this 
will be within a few years to many of those 
who will become members of the senior 
body and who will come into the organiza- 
tion more or less familiar not only with its 
purposes and scope, but with its methods of 
operation. 


ALLIANCE, Nes.—The junior department 
of the Alliance Commercial Club, organized 
about three months ago, as in the cases of 
the three junior organizations mentioned 
above, is performing a valuable function 
as an auxiliary to the senior organization. 
The members are helping in the campaign 
for a community building for Alliance, an 
undertaking being fostered by the parent 
organization, and it is expected that they” 
will be used extensively in working for im- 
provements at the City Park and also in a 
clean-up campaign. 

The purposes of the Junior Commercial 
Club, as listed in the constitution of that 
organization, are: (1) To study the civic 
and industrial life of the city by first-hand 
observation; (2) to learn to think seriously 
and wisely concerning the various voca- 
tions being taught; (3) to keep the city 
clean and to codperate with the city of- 
ficials to the fullest extent of their ability; 
(4) to strive to make the city flyless, and 
with that end in view they have asked the 
cooperation of every merchant and citizen 
of the city; (5) to connect the work of the 
public schools more closely with the life 
of the community; (6) to have debates 
along the line of civic affairs; and (7) to 
help build more parks and playgrounds and 
see that such property is protected.

study. Entertainment was provided in the 
form of illustrated lectures on industrial 
topics planned to interest the general pub- 
lic, including moving pictures of manu- 
facturing plants, coal mines, ete. Manu- 
facturers showed samples of their product, 
finished and in the process of making, and 
an effort was made to give the public a

tured. Merchants had attractive displays 
of their wares.

I want to help make our town a better place to live in, and to 
this end I promise to comply with the following rules to the best of 


1. I will help clean up yards, streets and alleys. 

2. I will plant flower seeds, bulbs, vines, shrubbery, etc. 

3. I will help make garden, and keep lawn in good condition. 

4. I promise not to deface fences or buildings, neither will I 
scatter paper or rubbish in public places.

With the codperation of the Superinten- 
dent of Schools, a Junior Civic Club, con- 
sisting of about 650 members, was organ- 
ized in the seven school districts of the city. 
Each scholar desiring to become a member 
of the Junior Civic Club was requested to 


conditions which he desired to improve. 
The form of the membership card is here- 
with reproduced. ; 

A letter was addressed to the parents of 
the members of the club stating that the 
Kewanee Civic Club offered cash prizes to

250 THE AMERICAN CITY 


the children who would make the most 
progress in cleaning up yards at home, 
planting flowers, making gardens, etc. For 
the best showing in each school district 
were offered $5 in gold for the first prize 
and $2.50 in gold for the second prize. All 
the children who had made an honest effort 
to clean up and beautify their yards were 
to be given a diploma of award, signed by 
the Committee and the Superintendent of 
Schools. The taking of the pictures was 
the most expensive item in connection with 
this plan, but the expenses were materially 
kept down because the Camera Club of the 
High School contributed largely of their 
time 

A committee of five was appointed to do 
the judging in each school district. The 
committees started their work about July 1, 
and upon its completion made their formal 
report to the Civic Improvement Committee. 
The points considered by them in judging 
a yard were as follows: 

1. Cleanliness of back yard with reference 
to rubbish of all sorts—cans, broken glass, ash 
piles, straw, chips, or litter of any kind 

2. Freedom of entire premises from weeds 

3. Unsightly fences or sheds covered with 
vines or screened with flowering plants, such 
as hollyhocks or castor beans 

4. Ornamentation by means of flower beds 

5. Front yard: grassy lawn kept well 


mowed, including parking strip 

6. Walks kept clean and free from rubbish; 
weeds or tall grass not allowed to grow along 
edge of walks 

7. Utilization of back yards for garden pur- 
poses; gardens to be kept free from weeds

to be surrounded with tall-growing flowering 
plants so as to be screened from view ot

9. Driveways to be kept free from weeds 
and litter of all kinds 

10. Yards ‘to be smooth or level, free from 
large stones, clods or unsightly hummocks. 

11. Alleys adjacent to yards to be cleaned 
up. 

[he scoring was based on the following: 

1. General cleanliness of yard, both front 
and rear (absence of rubbish of all kinds), 30 
per cent 

2. Neatness and trimness of lawn, 20 per 
cent 

3. Ornamentation: flowering bulbs, vines or 
shrubs to cover unsightly fences or out-build- 
ings, 10 per cent 

4. General appearance, 20 per cent 

5. Cleaning alleys, 20 per cent 

rhe prizes and diplomas were awarded 
the children at the Chautauqua on the af- 
ternoon that the Ojibway Indians gave their 
program; there were a large number pres- 
ent on that day, and the 75 or more boys 
and girls who received prizes and diplomas 
were admitted free of charge. 

Attempts had been made for a number of 
years to get the children interested in beau- 
tifying their yards, but for one reason of 
another they had not been successful. Last 
year’s contest created great enthusiasm 
and a friendly rivalry among the children, 
and worked wonderful results. It is planned 
to make the contest this year even more 
interesting than last year by adopting a 
different system for scoring the yards both 
before and at the close of the contest. The 
children will be encour- 
aged to build and put up 
bird houses. A contest in 
the growing of flowers 
and vegetables will be 
conducted, and in the fall 
there will be an exhibit of 
garden products, with 
prizes for the best show- 
ing. The use of window 
flower boxes in the down- 
town districts will be rec- 
ommended. It is planned 
to give the members of 
the Junior Civic Club a 
motion picture entertain- 
ment showing what other 
places have done in such 
improvement work.

Street Lighting at the Panama-Pacific Inter- 
national Exposition 
By Arthur A. Willoughby 


ORE attention has been given to illu- 
M mination in its varied forms at the 
Panama-Pacific International Ex- 
position than at any previous one. The 
Exposition is intended to be in itself an 
example of the new science of illumination. 
Flood lighting from concealed sources 
for the double purpose of lighting up the 
building exteriors and thus indirectly pro- 
viding illumination for surrounding road- 
ways and paths is a new departure. The 
light is a softened effect through the use of 
efficient glassware, and is not tiresome to 
the eye. In the courts between the main 
exhibit palaces, a great deal of the lighting 
is accomplished by means of batteries of 
searchlights, and this affords lighting for 
the courts indirectly from the walls of the 
surrounding structures in addition to spe- 
cial illuminative effects which may be used 
for spectacular purposes. 

The main group of eight exhibit palaces 
is in block form and is surrounded by wide, 
tree-bordered avenues. Lofty arc standards 
have been placed along the inner edges of 
the avenues about this area, with symmet- 
rical spacings. A series of magnetite cir- 
cuits has been installed and lamps have 
been set on the standards. The lamps are 
arranged in I-, 2-, 3-, 5- and 9-lamp fix- 
tures, and either have ornamental staff 
bases and staff deflectors, or are equipped 
with a steel framework for carrying deco- 
rative banners which act as reflectors. The 
banners are hung on the outer front and 
to either side of the lamp fixtures to throw 
the light toward the buildings. The walls, 
which are of travertine color, will in turn 
furnish a secondary field of illumination 
for the area behind the lamps. The orna- 
mental banners, which are heraldic in na- 
ture, are to a small extent translucent, and 
the ornamental staff deflectors have panels 
of translucent fabric which allows a mild 
giow to be seen from the back of the fix- 
tures. 

The street lighting in the court-ways, the 
South Gardens and portions of the water 
front consists of ornamental incandescent 
staff standards, on which are mounted high- 
efficiency lamps ranging from 400 to 1,500 
watts. Along the roadways surrounding 


[252] 


the South Gardens, the lights are arranged 
in clusters, while elsewhere they are single 
units 

Perfect lighting is thus obtained for the 
avenues through secondary sources. It is 
a studied effect without being an obtrusive 
one. Everything has been so carefully ar- 
ranged that it has the appearance of being 
one large unit of illumination, whereas it is 
made up of a number of units, each in- 
tended to meet its own conditions. On the 
seaward side of the buildings, the foliage 
is not so luxuriant, with the result that the 
lighting presents no serious difficulties. The 
Avenue of Palms, which skirts the south- 
ern facade of the exhibit palace group, be- 
fits its name and is a mass of verdant fol- 
iage, requiring special attention to lighting 
details. Ornamental staff standards with 
single incandescent lighting units are inter- 
spersed among the trees. 

Throughout the State and Foreign Build- 
ing section of the exposition grounds has 
been made the first installation in the 
United States, on a commercial scale, of 
high-pressure gas lamps for street lighting. 
Gas lighting is used exclusively for the 
streets in this section. The numerous 
streets and avenues are lighted by means 
of two-mantle high-pressure lamps mounted 
singly on the top of ornamental staff col- 
umns 18 feet high. These columns line 
both sides of the street, with spacings to 
suit the conditions. A line of the col- 
umns is also placed on the parapet wall ex- 
tending along the water-front from the 
California building west to the live stock 
exhibit section. The installation utilizes

A regulating device in the base of each 
column reduces the pressure of 30 pounds 
carried in the distributing pipe system to 
3 pounds, at which pressure the lamps are 
operated. The globe used is of dense white 
glass, 18 inches in diameter, and forms a 
secondary source of illumination. The re- 
sulting brilliancy is low, yet the illumination 
secured is amply sufficient and is not tire- 
some to view. Each lamp consumes 21 
cubic feet of gas per hour and gives off 
408 mean spherical candle-power. The gas 
used is made from crude California petro-

The main thing to be noted in the instal- 
lation of the various public utilities on the

grounds is that they have been as carefully 
designed and executed as for permanent 
use. This is a new feature in the conduct 
of expositions. Utilities which municipali- 
ties have been years in acquiring are here 
to be seen for only a few months’ use. Con- 
duit work for the wires and piping has been 
used exclusively throughout the exhibit pal- 
ace district and constructed in a substan- 
tial manner.\. This is true of the various 
other engineering features. 





Legal Handicaps in the Billboard Problem 
By Everett L. Millard 


Chairman, Municipal Art Committee, City Club of Chicago 


UBLIC opinion seems to have outrun 
PP the courts in the question of bill- 
board control, as in so many other 
matters. Offenses to the eye are not con- 
sidered subject to’régulation in the main by 
American courts, although the other four 
senses are carefully protected. The ear, 
the nose, the senses of taste and touch, must 
not be wantonly violated by anyone for his 
own profit; but sight, the greatest of them 
all, may be flagrantly abused by ugly adver- 
tising, and the offense dismissed on the 
ground that it is only to the esthetic sense. 
Constitutional amendments are needed to 
put beauty on the protected list. In time 
the courts may follow public opinion more 
closely, of their own accord, but they have 
unfortunately created much precedent 
which ties their hands. 

Outdoor advertising may, however, now 
be regulated as to features that affect public 
safety from fire, accident and crime, health 
and morals. It is not too much to say that 
some courts now permit offense to the 
esthetic sense to be considered as a sub- 
sidiary and additional objection, if it is not 
made the main reliance. From the cases 
we now have, a municipality can find strong 
support for extensive restriction, and even 
prohibition in proper instances. Such an 
ordinance must be skillfully drawn, how- 
ever, to avoid ‘the charge that its pro- 
visions are unreasonable and an abuse of 
the discretion reposed in the authorities. 

The recent opinion of the Supreme Court 
of Illinois in the case of Cusack vs. City of 
Chicago, in upholding the validity of an 
ordinance, has greatly strengthened the 


hands of the municipality and restricted 
the debatable margin between reasonable 
and unreasonable exercise of the power of 
regulation. The decision is not yet pub- 
lished, as a petition for rehearing has been 
filed and not yet decided. 

The city of Chicago passed a billboard 
ordinance in I91I, in which, among other 
provisions for the safety of the public, it 
was required that frontage consents be ob- 
tained from the owners of a majority of 
the property on both sides of a street in a 
block in which a billboard was to be erected 
if such block were one in which one-half 
the buildings on both sides of the street 
were used exclusively for residence pur- 
poses. Upon an inspection made by the 
Municipal Art Committee of the City Club, 
it was found that many boards were erected 
without compliance with this ordinance. In 
one particularly flagrant case, at a turn in 
Sheridan Road, a board was erected in a 
residence district, which blocked the view 
of several miles of lake frontage from all 
those passing north on that important boule- 


vard. A frontage consent had been filed j 


with the Building Commissioner, but was 
fotind to be prima facie and, in fact, insuf- 
ficient. The City Club committee induced 


the city Building Department to order the ; 


board torn down, and thereupon the Cusack 
Company obtained an injunction from the 
Superior Court of Cook County prohibiting 
the city from enforcing this section of the 
ordinance. The upper court reversed the 
decision and dismissed the injunction on the 
evidence produced in the court below, hold- 
ing that the city had the power to pass the 












Sates Tee be as. 




















THE 


regulatory ordinance in question and that 
it was a proper and reasonable exercise of 
such power. 


How the City’s Case Was Presented 

The existence of the power to legislate 
upon the subject of billboards has been in 
less doubt than the question of what was 
a reasonable exercise of such power. Much 
evidence was introduced by the city in its 
thorough presentation of the case. It was 
shown that fires had been started from the 
accumulation of combustible material that 
had lodged against the base of billboards; 
that the residence territory of the city is 
not so well protected with fire extinguish- 
ing apparatus as the business district; that 
the boards offered a protection to disor- 
derly and law-breaking persons, and that 
residence districts are not afforded as full 
police protection as other districts in the 
city of Chicago; that women and children 
are on the streets unaccompanied in larger 
numbers and more frequently in residence 
districts than in other places, and that, of 
the crimes against women and children, the 
most flagrant are indecent exposure and 
offenses against the person. It was shown 
that the rear of the boards was darker than 
the space would have been without the 
boards, even where electric lights were on 
the front surface, and that the two most 
important elements contributing to crimes 
in cities were, first, absence of police, and 
second, darkness. It was shown that nuis- 
ances were permitted to exist in the rear 
of surface billboards which bred disease 
germs that might be carried by the wind 
and by flies and by other insects. It was 
shown that dissolute and immoral practices 
were carried on behind such boards. 

The court quoted the case of Gunning 
Advertising Company vs. City of St. Louis, 
239 Mo. 99, in holding that other structures 
or buildings affording a like screen from 
view did not tend to produce similar results, 
and that it did not appear that the discretion 
reposed in the municipal authorities had 
been abused in the exercise, in this instance, 
of the power to regulate. It held that the 
previous ordinance which it had declared 
void in the case of City of Chicago vs. 
Gunning System, 214 III. 268, was different 
as having made no distinction in its restric- 
tive conditions as to the portion of the city 
in which boards were located. 

The court further held that a requirement 


AMERICAN C 


by igh 2 


of frontage consents of property owners 
within reasonable limits is a proper mode 
of exercising the power of regulation 
vested in the municipality. Such ordinances 
have been upheld by this court in regard 
to livery stables, dram shops and garages. 


The Right to Abolish Billboards in 


Residence Districts 


From this 


decision it logically follows 
that the city has the right entirely to pro- 
hibit billboards in residence districts, be- 
cause the requirement of frontage consents 
in its full application means that the boards 
are prohibited in such districts, subject to 
the right of waiver of such 


prohibition 
granted to the property owners. 


. Cherefore 
—as far as Illinois is concerned, and such 
other states as follow this precedent, if it 
is made final—under like conditions muni- 
cipalities are assured of their ability greatly 
to restrict the number of billboards by shut- 
ting them out of residence blocks. . Prob- 
ably it would be proper to prohibit boards 
on vacant lots, if surrounding blocks were 
occupied for residence purposes. The 
preme Court of the United States takes a 
broad view of the extent of the police 
powers of a city, and it is probable that, 
with the thorough and careful preparation 
ot a case, most courts outside of Illinois 
would follow this precedent and that such 
action would not be overturned by the high- 
est court, as depriving property owners of 
their property without due process of law 

The former cases on the subject have 
uniformly upheld the right of municipali 
ties to prohibit obscene or immoral adver- 
tising on boards, and to control, from con- 
siderations of public safety, the size of the 
board and its location on the lot or build- 
ing, even though private property. Limi- 
tation of size, raising above the surface of 
the ground, setting back from the lot line, 
as required by the St. Louis ordinance, and 
prohibition of erection on roofs of build- 
ings, as provided in the Chicago ordinance, 
have all been upheld by the courts, or sup- 
ported by analagous precedent. 

In these utilitarian lines municipalities 
may, therefore, hope to accomplish great 
reforms, even without a recognition of the 
esthetic element by the courts. Some means 
of extending these remedies to prevent the 
disfigurement of open country spaces along 
railroad tracks must now be found.

A Course in Housing and 
Town Planning 

A course in Housing and Town Planning 
has been organized in connection with the 
summer school of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, to begin the first week of July 
and continue for six weeks. It will be 
given by the following: Dr. Carol Arono- 
vici, Mr. Bernard J. Newman, secretary of 
the Philadelphia Housing Commission, Mr. 
B. Antrim Haldeman, engineer in charge of 
city planning work in Philadelphia, and 
Professor James P. Lichtenberger, of the 
University of Pennsylvania. 

The course is intended for housing in- 
spectors, students of the housing problem, 
town planning commissioners, and other 
persons interested in housing and town 
planning work. It will consist of a series 
of lectures on the influence of bad housing 
upon the individual, methods of housing re 
form through legislation and municipal con- 
trol, and the development of community 
planning as an ally of housing reform. 

Dr. Aronovici will give a course on the 
economics of housing and town planning, 
and will conduct laboratories and excur- 
sions through the city of Philadelphia and 
the suburbs, as well as more distant com- 
munities, with a view to familiarizing stu- 
dents with actual work.

A Peace Program for Schools 

With the celebration on February 17 of 
the completion of a century of peace be 
tween the United States and Canada, a 
peace program was inaugurated in the pub 
lic schools of Buffalo, to continue for three 
months. During this time there will be 
daily emphasis in the classrooms on methods 
by which world concord may be preserved 
without forts, soldiers or battleships, and 
the program will culminate in the usual 
celebration of Peace Day on May 18. 

A statement signed by Henry P. Emer- 
son, Superintendent of Education, says: 

“During these three months each school will 
have evolved a peace program of its own, and 
each child will have learned some of the im- 
portant lessons to be learned from 100 years 


[256]

of peace—such as the fact that a treaty, 
backed by mutual faith, trust and neighbor- 
liness, has kept peace for 100 years. If it can 
do so along a boundary of 3800 miles, is it 
not an object lesson showing us how to keep 
peace along all boundary lines between all 
nations ° 

“What it means to any two countries to have 
fear of one another eliminated from the lives 
1f the people of each nation may give oppor- 
tunities for many discussions and composi- 
tions.” 

[his document was accompanied by an 
outline program for three grades of schools, 
a copy of the Rush-Bagot agreement, 
a brief on the signing of the treaty of 
Ghent, and a copy of a peace hymn, all of 
which were printed by the boys in the print- 
ing department of the Elm _ vocational 


school.

School Gardens from Dumping Lots 


Portland has made war upon the un- 
sightly vacant lots where it was the custom 
of the people to dump rubbish of all sorts. 

How to dispose of these public eyesores 
was a much-discussed problem; the final 
solution came when the idea of turning the 
lots over to the school children to be util- 
ized in their agricultural education met with 
favor both with the citizens and the pupils. 

No more spreading weeds would meet the 
eyes of the people who wanted to see a 
“City Beautiful.” The city would be saved 
hundreds of dollars, and there would be no 
need to hire men to cut the weeds. Agri- 
cultural work by the pupils was an organ- 
ized means of clearing the lots of tin cans 
and waste. 

Agriculture became one of the regular 
periods of the school work. Girls and boys 
delved into the task of becoming amateur 
farmers, each trying to outdo others in 
growing prize crops. Agricultural leagues 
were formed by the different school dis- 
tricts, all trying to win honor and the prizes 
offered by the business men of the city. 

A community or school must have at 
least 25 individual lots in order to enter 
the contest. Last year 43 school gardens 
competed, and much interest was mani- 
fested by pupils and teachers.

When Dreams Come True 
NDER this heading, The Reading 
Herald for January 4, 1915, quotes 
some of the recommendations made 
by John Nolen, of Cambridge, Mass., in his 
report on “Replanning Reading” in 1910, 
and summarizes the progress made during 
the intervening four years in transforming 
advice into accomplishment. The outline 
is worth quoting as a definite example of a 
city-planning report which is having a real 
effect on the development of a growing 
city : 


Ist. “To adopt a more thoughtful and up- 
to-date method of locating and improving 
streets.” 

We have a city-planning commission which 
is improving Centre Avenue much along the 
Nolen plan and which has charge of the roads 
round about Reading for a certain number of 
miles. 


2d. “To remove from the main street all 
wires, poles and other obstructions, with per- 
haps the exception of the trolley wires.” 

Wires are now being placed underground 
within the business section of town 

3d. “To take prompt and vigorous steps for 
the abatement of the smoke nuisance.” 

Not much has been done along these lines. 
The boiler inspector gave instructions how to 
stoke fires. 

4th. “To extend the city limits by annexing 
Mt. Penn and West Reading.” 

Brookside, Oakland, Millmont, Northmont 
and Flusheim have been annexed. 

5th. “To-add to the convenience, comfort 
and beauty of Penn Square by the construction 
of a central mall or narrow park strip.” 

We have come to Mr. Nolen’s way of think- 
ing along these lines evidently. Focus your 
eyes on the Christmas trees along the car 
tracks. 

6th. “To proceed at once to make the best 
possible grouping of public and semi-public 
buildings.” 

Mr. Nolen’s plan included a hotel at Fifth 
and Washington streets, and thus a start is 
being made. 

7th. “To lay out a comprehensive system 
of thoroughfares and boulevards, including 
diagonal avenues and a belt boulevard to en- 
circle the city.” 

The city-planning commission is 
along these lines now. 

8th. “To provide for the gradual abolition 
of all grade crossings within the city limits.” 

We are going Mr. Nolen one better and an 
effort is now being made to eliminate all in the 
city and the greater number in the county 
An inspection of the crossings with this end 
in view was made but a short time ago. 

oth. “To build across the river a series of 
bridges of a more appropriate type.” 

It is enough to say that the Bingaman Street 
bridge, according to certain officials, will be 


working 


259 
replaced within five years, and to take a peep 
at the Penn Street bridge 

10th. “To secure at once for playground 


purposes as many open spaces as possible, es- 
pecially about 10 acres of ground in the vicin- 
ity of Tulpehocken and Oley Streets.” 

Baer Park has been presented to the city 
It lies just a block beyond the point suggested 
by Mr. Nolen. 

11th. “To get possession of the 
ural features about Reading and set them 
for public parks.” 

The conservation organization is 
move in the right direction 
12th. “To investigate 
the improvement of 

Reading.” 

Mayor Stratton cleaned out the House of 
saystery and had it rebuilt, as well as a num 
ber of other holes. The Chamber of Com 
merce made an investigation 

Thus it does seem as if a large number of 
John Nolen’s recommendations are coming in 

opposition that

against the movement in certain quarters, and

Kansas and the Filthy Fly 

A pointed message prepared by the Kan 
sas State Board of Health as part of its 
campaign against flies is shown in the ac- 
companying card. Customers who object to 
buying food over which flies have crawled 
are encouraged to spend their time, while 
waiting at the butcher's, grocer’s or baker’s, 
counting the flies. They may then protest 
incognito by sending to the storekeeper one 
of the little 134- by 3-inch cards provided 
by the State Board of Health, bearing in 
black and white the results of their observa 
tion. This looks like an effective way of 
stirring up the merchants to anti-fly activ- 
ity. Is not the plan worth trying in other 
states?

THE AMERI 


Tree Planting Month 

The citizens of Dallas, Tex., responded 
energetically to the proclamation of Mayor 
Holland designating February, I915, as 
ree Planting Month. The Park Board, by 
a resolution quoted in the proclamation, di 
rected the Park Engineer, subject to ap 
proval by the City Engineer, to furnish fre 
of cost the tree line on sidewalks undet 
certain conditions stated in the resolution, 
and a report of the Park Superintendent 
was also included recommending the va 
riety, size and method of planting best 
adapted to that section and climate. With 
the codperation of the Superintendent of 
Public Schools it was urged that school 
children should plant trees on all school 
property in February, and every hous« 
holder was asked to plant at least one tr: 
during the month. The Park Board agreed 
to set out thousands of trees in the various 
parks of the city. The matter was tak 
up by several improvement societies, and 
one league alone planted more than 890 
trees. On Marsalis Avenue the peopl 
planted trees on both sides of the street 
throughout its entire length, a distance of 
more than one mile.

Health Lessons to Women Through 
the Public Schools 


In every community there are, no doubt, 
many women who would be glad to lear 
more about the prevention of sickness an 
the care of the sick and injured. To meet 
this demand in Rochester, a plan christened 


“Live a Little Longer” was originated, and 
under the direction of the “Live a Littl 
Longer” General Committee of Rochester, 
endorsed by the Board of Education, the 
Chamber of Commerce, the Ministerial As 
sociation, the Women’s Educational and In 
dustrial Union, and the Life Underwriters’ 
\ssociation, it has been worked out with 
much profit to those who have participated 
and with growing responsiveness on_ the 
part of many classes of women in the city 
The plan consists of classes, held in the 
public schools outside of school hours, to 
which women eighteen years of age or 
older are eligible 
doctors and nurses engaged by the Board 
of Education, and all expenses—as for 
demonstration material—are met by the 
board as a part of its regular scheme of

again proposed for the exemption from taxa- 
tion of bonds of the state and its political 
subdivisions ; 

(8) That municipalities be authorized to bor- 
row from their special funds upon certificates 
of indebtedness issued in anticipation of the 
ollection of taxes. 


the conference approved these recom- 
mendations. It also proposed a general 
constitutional amendment to revise the 
system of taxation in the state. The most 
important feature in the proposed amend- 
ment is the provision which would in effect 
abolish the present uniform rule and per- 
mit the classification of property for the 
purpose of taxation. Committees of the 
league have been appointed to promote the 
adoption of the proposed amendment by the 
people and to secure the adoption by the 
Legislature of the changes proposed by the 
committee on municipal finances. 

Mayor E. G. Martin, of Norwalk, was 
elected President of the League for the en- 
suing year, and F. W. Coker, of Ohio State 
University, was reélected Secretary-Treas- 
urer. Other officers elected are Stewart L.

League of Washington Municipalities 


At the Fifth Annual Convention of the 
League of Washington Municipalities, 
which met in Olympia January 25-27, the 
following officers were elected for the en- 
suing year: 

Secretary—E. L. Powers, Editor Good Rodds. 

Vice-President—H. M. Stephens, Corporation Coun 
sel. Spokane. 

_Secretary-Treasurer—Herman A. Brauer, University 
of Washington, Seattle. 

The next convention will be held at North 
Yakima in October of this year.

[he existing sections and standing com- 
mittees of the League are continued, and 
in addition there was organized a section 
of mayors, commissioners and councilmen 
with the following officers elected by the 
convention : 

Chairman—Dr. Joseph | Barton, Mayor, North 
Yakima 

Vice-Chairman—J. S. McKee, Mayor, Ho 

Secretary—R. C. Vandevort, ( ! n 

The League is fortunate in having for 
its headquarters the Bureau of Municipal 
Research at the State University. By this 
arrangement it secures without expense to 
itself all the advantages of a permanent, 
non-partisan headquarters, in charge of 
trained workers, and with extensive collec- 
tions of municipal information already ex- 
isting on the shelves of the bureau and the 
various university libraries. The Chief of 
the Bureau is secretary and treasurer of 
the League and municipal editor of its 
official paper, the Pacific Builder and Engi- 
neer. He also conducts its correspondence 
and keeps its accounts. All the League’s 
officers serve without pay, and running ex- 
penses are therefore kept at the lowest pos- 
sible figure. On the other hand, the Uni- 
versity benefits by the inspiration and prac- 
tical outlook which come from close touch 
and personal cooperation with city officials

The reason why the ‘‘ PENNSYLVANIA”

every blade, stationary and revolving, is made of the highest grade of crucible tool 
steel, oil-hardened and water-tempered. It’s the only Mower of which this is true. 
Every “PENNSYLVANIA” Quality Mower has every blade of this same high

HE City Playground is one of the greatest 

advances. municipalities have made. Cities 
today are vieing with one another in having the

In this modern development one significant 
feature is noticeable. Chicago, and many 
other cities and towns are writing into their

bath houses must be equipped with 


INGHAM 


Shower Mixers 


This ts a move for efficiency, economy and health 


ep sHERE is nothing so healthful and invigorating as 

I a shower bath. Especially to young people living 

in the crowded city districts. The large increase 

in athletic events held on Playgrounds demands greater 
shower facilities 

All this means capacity crowds, the handling of which 
requires a device that is speedy and efficient. 

The Ingham Shower Mixer gives the bather instant 
control of the water. A turn of the handle, and desired 
temperature is obtained. This remains fixed. 

Thorough mixing takes place in chamber. No 
waste of steam. Therefore, no waste of heat and fuel 
Scalding impossible. Simple, safe, ‘‘Foolproof,’’ auto-

Putting Out the Fire 


A demonstration of the possibilities of the 
Dayton tri-car chemical fire extinguisher was 
made in Wapakoneta, Ohio, last month. A 
huge pile of boxes and other rubbish was 
placed on a small strip of land near a park, 
five gallons of gasoline was poured on the 
pile, and it was set on fire at exactly 12:10 
P. M. The alarm was sent to fire department 
headquarters, where the chemical car was 
stationed. At exactly 12:11 the car, with two 
employes of the Davis Sewing Machine Com 
pany, of Dayton, Ohio, its manufacturers, left 
the station. In one minute and thirty-two 
seconds the car was at the fire, and one minute 
and thirty seconds later the fire had been en 
tirely extinguished. The run was three-quar- 
ters of a mile, with four sharp turns, and the 
time from its start to the extinguishment of 
the fire was three minutes and two seconds. 

This car is claimed to be a necessary ad- 
junct to the fire-fighting equipment of small 
cities. Larger cities are also beginning to find 
it of great value in addition to their heavier 
apparatus. The front part consists of a truck, 
on which the following equipment is carried: 
one 35-gallon chemical tank, 200 feet of hose, 
a 12-foot extension ladder, pick, axe, crowbar, 
pike pole, two coal-oil lanterns and two 
3-gallon hand extinguishers. The machine 
carries an extra charge of soda and acid, 
which is used in the chemical tank. The ma 
chine is equipped with electric lights, the cur- 
rent for which is furnished by an electrical 
generator, which operates whenever the ma- 
chine is running. The car is fitted with Day- 
ton airless tires, and on a paved street or ordi 
nary road will develop a speed of from 45 to 
48 miles per hour.

‘“‘Memo Book for Road 
and Paving Officials’’ 


A loose-leaf memorandum book has been 
issued by The Austin-Western Road Machin- 
ery Company, which is a unique departure 
from the ordinary catalogue. It may be called 
a catalogue of catalogues, as it summarizes the 
contents of ten catalogues published by this 
company. The attractive cover design, “An 
Idyll of the Sea,” is lithographed on celluloid 
in twelve colors. One side of each page is left 
blank for notes; on the other side are printed 
illustrations and brief descriptions of every 
thing made by the company. This enables an 
inquirer, by referring to the index, to deter 
mine which particular catalogue he requires 
Each of these catalogues, containing from &o 
to 100 pages, gives a complete and comprehen- 
sive description of the machine to which it 
applies. A copy of the memo book will be

What a Million Mothers Avoid 


More than a million careful mothers have intuitively known the 
dangers of poisonous fly destroyers. They have known that such 
preparations contain arsenic in deadly quantities. They have real- 
ized the peril to little children that accompanies the use of fly poisons. 

But for those who have not learned of these dangers, we quote 
from a recent issue of the Child Betterment Magazine, which com 
ments upon 35 cases of children being poisoned last year: 


“The danger to children is great, and the danger to adults is by no means 


In the December issue of The Journal of the Michigan State 
Medical Society, an editorial on the same subject cites 17 cases 


as dangerous as the phosphorus match They should

Poisonous Fly-Paper

printed in pamphlet form from The Journal of 
the Michigan State Medical Society, and calls 
attention to many cases of children’s illness 
caused by the use of fly poisons,-a number of 
which resulted in death. 

“The danger is especially great to the children of 
the foreign-born, for, as is well known, many of the 
foreigners are slow to call medical aid in case of 
children’s ailments In country districts. where it 
often takes several hours to get a physician, it is 
especially dangerous to use fivy poisons

catching or killing flies, and fly poisons, if used at all,

Roots taken from sewers in Wausau. 


Roots 
Actually Grew 
in Wausau’s Sewers 


Into the very heart of Wausau’s sewers, roots 
entered and blocked the pipe and grew and 
grew. What was to be done? Tear up the 
sewers, clean them out and relay them! That 
was one method offered, but expensive and 
difficult 


Now—Every Foot is Clean 


All that blocked the sewers has been removed by the Turbine Sewer Clean 
ing Machine without tearing up the streets or relaying new pipe. 

Wausau, Wis., grasped the opportunity offered by the Turbine and cleaned 
1,600 feet of sewers at less than 2% to 3 cents a foot The results you see in 
the illustrations on this page. They tell the story of what we did. 

Roots, sand, brick, etc., perhaps may be in your sewers. Unhealthful con 
ditions may exist. Do 
you knowit? Then why 
not follow Wausau’s wise 
judgment and investi- 
gate the merits of the 
Turbine. 

Yes—the Turbine does 
a big work in a short 
time and saves hundreds 
of dollars. It will do 
the same for your city.

THE AMERICAN CITY 








Quality and Reputation 


LL of the seeds, plants and bulbs that a city or an individual 
purchases are bought on the reputation of the seller. Even 
the most thoroughly trained seedsman or horticulturist is unable 
to give a satisfactory opinion without exhaustive tests, and wit] 
this fact in mind it is always desirable to first investigate the 
reputation of your seedsman. ‘The business of Peter Henderson 
& Co. was established in 1847 and has been built to its present 
proportions by the most careful attention to quality. 

The third generation of Hendersons are in charge to-day and 
there is something more than just a plain business relationship 
existing between themselves; their employees and their custom 
ers. When you buy Henderson’s seeds you buy 69 vears of 
experience; you buy the prestige and reputation of years of 
successful seed raising and selling; vou buy seeds that have 
behind them the sentiment brought out by many years of careful 
conscientious attention to our customers 
and their wants. The very smallest part 
of the cost is represented by the seeds and 
it is by far the most important. ‘Try the 
Henderson Way this year and see if there 
isn’t a difference. 

We should be glad to send our 200-page 
catalogue without charge to anyone met

“Everwear Stands Wear and Tear” 





“EVERWEAR” Roller Bearing Clamps are for mounting swings, 
flying and traveling rings—built to clamp on 2”, 214”, 3”, 4”, 5”, and 6” 
pipe. Simple but clever—correct in design and construction. 

We give you an “inside” view. As the load sets this in motion and 
it swings back and forth, you notice what happens to the clamp? The 
' bearings ROLL—they obviate friction 
they increase the enjoyment of the device 
and prolong the life of ‘“ Everwear”’ 
apparatus. This is just one of our so- 
mM called “little things’’ to which we have 
IN given careful atten- 
Sy tion like all the 
others. Prices if you 
ask for them.

Protect Your Fine Trees 
From Injury

barked and skinned tree is always unsightly. If it dies, there’s 
nothing to do but wait years for a new tree to grow. The use of

is tree insurance. The investment is nothing compared to the 
value it protects. ‘The guards last many years. They are so 
heavily galvanized that they need no painting. They do not 
detract from the beauty of your trees or lawn. 

Ask your hardware dealer. If he does not have Excelsior Rust Proof

Our trees are grown with straight stems—abso-

Our trees have well developed, symmetrical heads,

CITY AND PARK TREES 


The trees of our cities and parks are becoming beautifully less from lack of care and attention, note 
the broken limbs and dead wood that strew the ground after a storm. 

I can remedy this condition by making an inspection, and furnishing experienced men to carry out 
the necessary work, or furnish directions from which local men can do the same.

By 


The Commission for Relief in Belgium 














Official Clearing House for All Belgium Relief 





We, as Americans, are enlisted for the war to save seven million men, 
women and children. _ It is the greatest commissary undertaking in the history 
of the world, and in the lexicon of America there is no such word as fail. 


We Need Food Supplies as Well as Cash 


Every penny donated to this Commission goes, without reserve, for the purchase 
of food. Money donated wiil be credited to your state; and whenever it can be done 
advantageously, spent within the borders of your state. We pay the freight from 
a special fund donated to organization and transportation 


Railroads, express companies, postoffices, governors and state committees are aiding 
Our Flotilla of Mercy, comprising thirty-five chartered ships, is constantly carrying 
food. But—Our Supplies Are Far Too Short! 

Has Your State Sent a Ship to Belgium? Is It Planning to Send One? 
Is there a committee for Belgium relief in your community? 
If there is none, start one under our official sanction. 


Are You Helping? If Not, Send In Your Name Now! 
Mark your donation “For the Food Fund” 


Make out your check or money order, or send cash either to the state committee 
sanctioned by this Commission or to the New York Headquarters :

THE AMERICAN CITY 


KALAMAZOO 
CHAMBER OF (COMMERCE 


February 17, 1915. 
Mr. Jorome Bogle, 


Brazil, Indiana. 
Dear Sir: 


In reply to your letter of the 13th inst. I am glad to write 
you regarding the recent reorganization of the Kalamazoo Commercial Club. 
On the first of January we had about 400 members at $12.00 a year. To- 
day we have 522 at $25.00. Of these fully 200 are men who were formerly 
lukewarm or even antagonistic to the commercial organization. 


When the idea of having an educational and membership campaign 
was first broached to the directors of the old Commercial Club, they were 
strongly opposed to the plan. Kalamazoo was sharing in the general busi- 
ness uncertainty and the directors felt a successful campaign could not 
be conducted at this time. They were certain, too, that raising the dues 
from $12.00 to $25.00 would limit the membership very decidedly. However 
we finally arranged with the American City Bureau to undertake the work. 


Anstead of an income of less than five thousand dollars we now 
have one of more than $13,000 subscribed for three years with fully two 
thousand more in sight. Our citizens are together as never before in 
their history. In fact our city has set a record for work and enthus- 
iasm. Between one and two hundred of our very best men met each day at 
dinner. Forty to sixty gave of their time daily for ten days to make the 
organization possible. Men are interested who never realized before that 
they owed anything to their city except their taxes. In short, there is 


an esprit de corps in the city that is worth many times the amount of the 
American City Bureau's bill. 


No, we could not have achieved this result alone. Wilson ad- 
dressed in all fifteen meetings---answering svery argument, dissolving 
every prejudice, overcoming every obstacle. He visited a score of hard 
cases with our committees and broke down the opposition as we never 
could have done. 

Braddock is a natural leader of men and easily kept the enthus- 
iasm and determination of our workers at white-heat. He has every detail 
for his campaigns worked out so that they move forward with the precision 
of a military movement. 


Our pessimists have now changed their tune from “It can't be 
done" to "It won't last." And in this I feel certain they are equally 
mistaken. Braddock is still here and has organized a real civic machine. 
He has built a platform of program of work from the composite opimions 
of all our members. He is forming a system of committee control that will 


put the planks of his platform in the hands of men who really want to see 
them carried out. 


It will last. Nothing but incompetence can prevent it. 
Very truly yours, 


Secretary:

The Toy Scraper rolls on wheels so that it can be pushed around without wearing 
out either scraper or street pavement. 

There is a lever attachment on the handle which when pressed lifts the collected 
dirt from the ground so that it can be carried wherever desired. By the same method 
it dumps itself. Let us send you our pamphlet.

Experience 


is an even more valuable guide in street paving than it is in 
most things. 

An experience of more than 30 years is back of Trinidad 
and Bermudez Lake Asphalts. The picture above shows a 
34-year-old Trinidad Lake Asphalt pavement—Vermont 
Avenue, Washington, D. C. 

About 200,000,000 square yards of these pavements have 
been constructed—affording impressive evidence of the pref- 
erence given to this form of paving by progressive communi- 
ties, small and large, everywhere. 

Any community that discards this experience to experi- - 
ment with substitutes for natural lake asphalt is taking a 
risk instead of taking advantage of the certainty of good 
service from Trinidad and Bermudez Lake Asphalts. 

Of course there are claimed to be many “‘just-as-good-as- 
lake asphalts,”’ but the man-made has never approached 
nature-made asphalt in service. 

A booklet titled ‘““Evidence”’ gives an illustrated record of 
the experience of 30 cities with Trinidad and Bermudez Lake 
Asphalt pavements. This booklet is sent free to those in- 
terested in getting the most in paving for their money. A 
postal card will bring it.
